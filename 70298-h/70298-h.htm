<h2 class="nobreak">THE DEFORMITIES OF THE
FINGERS AND TOES</h2>

</div>

<p>The section of surgical disease treated in the
following pages is unambitious in its scope, but it
is, nevertheless, one that deserves the attention of
every surgeon and pathologist, because it comprises
a group of ailments which are the source of
much pain and crippling, and because it offers
many problems of causation that are still unsolved.
It is true that none of these affections threaten
life, but in medicine, as in law, it is often the
value of the principle involved rather than the
magnitude of the interests immediately at stake
that invests the case with importance.</p>

<p>There is a material advantage to be gained by
studying the deformities of the hands together
with those of the feet, for it will be found that
nearly all the forms of contraction that appear in
the one are represented in the other, and a comparison
of the conditions under which the two sets
of affections arise may throw light upon the
pathogeny of both. At the same time, if we
glance at the structural and functional differences<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
in the hand and foot, and at the fact that civilised
life imposes artificial restraints upon the
freedom of action of the one, while it cultivates
to a marvellous degree of perfection the variety
and precision of movement in the other, we shall
understand that although certain deformities of
the fingers may have a strict pathological analogy
with those of the toes, the effects produced, and
the treatment required may differ essentially in
the two sets of cases.</p>

<p>It will be seen that our knowledge of some of
the affections to be described is of very recent
date, and that certain diseases, frequent in occurrence,
obvious in character, and very inconvenient
or painful in results, have only found a place in
our text-books within recent years. Even the
most ancient in point of literary existence scarcely
dates beyond the third decade of the present
century; while the youngest, when regarded in
the same aspect, is merely a child of a few
winters; and yet both the one and the other
may be nearly as old as mankind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SECTION_I">SECTION I<br>
<span class="smaller">CONTRACTIONS OF THE FINGERS</span></h2>

</div>

<p>These may be grouped as follows: 1. Contractions
due to pathological processes taking place in
the cutaneous and fascial structures of the palm
and palmar surface of the fingers. This includes the
so-called “contraction of the palmar fascia,” with
which the name of the great surgeon Dupuytren
is inseparably connected, as well as another
affection of similar character, but different pathological
origin. 2. Contractions due to developmental
irregularities in the bony and ligamentous
elements of the articulations. Under this heading
come the deformity which may be termed “hammer
finger” and the closely allied lateral distortions of
the digits—affections which are chiefly of importance
in their bearing upon analogous conditions of
the toes. 3. Contractions arising from shortening
of the finger flexors, without paralytic or spastic
complications. 4. Contractions due to unbalanced
action of the flexor muscles after accidental
solution of continuity of the extensor tendons.
5. Contractions arising from nutritive changes in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
the motor apparatus consequent upon long immobilisation
of the part, with pressure; or from inflammatory
processes in the inter-muscular planes,
or in the muscles themselves. 6. Contractions
dependent upon inflammatory articular disease of
traumatic or constitutional origin. 7. Contractions
of neuropathic origin, paralytic or spastic. Under
this denomination, as under the last, only those
questions which concern the surgeon will be taken
into consideration. 8. Trigger finger; a condition
not yet susceptible of scientific classification.
9. Congenital deformities not included under any
of the preceding headings.</p>

<h3 id="I_I">CONTRACTIONS INVOLVING THE DIGITAL AND
PALMAR FASCIÆ.</h3>

<p>The clinical features of the disease called
Dupuytren’s “contraction of the palmar fascia”
were well known before the true seat of the
morbid process was surmised; but the Greek and
Arab writers, and their European followers down
to the end of the last century, make no reference
to it. The first accessible descriptions are
those of Sir Astley Cooper in his “Treatise on
Fractures and Dislocations” published in 1822, and
of Boyer in the eleventh and last volume of his
“Maladies Chirurgicales,” issued in 1826. The latter
is really a very correct account from the clinical
aspect; and although the author could suggest no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
better pathological explanation than that implied
by the name “crispatura tendinum,” which he
found already given to the disease by previous
writers, in works that cannot now be traced, he
accepts it with commendable hesitation.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Sir
Astley Cooper, on the other hand, supplies a less
detailed description, but recognises the non-tendinous
origin of the disease. The classical essay,
however, was that of Dupuytren (1831), which,
partly from its intrinsic merits and partly from
the fame of the writer, attracted wide attention,
and called forth within the next few years a
number of eminently scientific observations upon
the pathology of the complaint. More recently
the affection has received close attention from
many distinguished surgeons in France, Germany,
America, and England.</p>

<p><i>Symptomatology.</i>—Before entering into the
symptomatology, I ought to premise that there
are to be distinguished two forms of the so-called
contraction of the palmar fascia: one in which the
condition occurs independently of any definite
traumatism and tends to multiplicity of lesion, the
other appearing as a result of an ordinary wound,
and confined to the parts in direct relation to the
injury. The first of these I propose to speak of as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
true Dupuytren’s contraction, the second as
traumatic contraction. The characteristics of the
latter will be referred to later.</p>

<p>The symptoms of the true form have been so
often and so graphically described that little can
be added to the current accounts. I shall, then,
limit my clinical picture to a simple outline, filled
in with a few details taken from the series of
examples which have been under my own observation.
In a typical case, a middle-aged or elderly
man notices in the course of the distal furrow, and
directly over the head of the metacarpal bone
of the ring or little finger, a small nodule in the
skin, or perhaps only a puckering and exaggeration
of the flexion line. By-and-by a ridge
appears running proximally from this point
towards the wrist, and distally along the central
axis of the finger. The ridge is prominent, round,
and very hard, especially between the flexion fold
and the root of the digit, and the skin is usually
drawn to it tightly at the seat of the initial sign.
It passes on to the front of the first phalanx,
nearly always preserving the central position, but
spreading out and usually sending processes to
the deep surface of the integument as it reaches
the first joint of the finger, and as it contracts,
draws down the metacarpal phalanx towards the
palm. After a while the second phalanx may
become bent in like manner, and by exception
even the distal bone. The articular structures<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
show no trace of disease, the tendons are normal,
the finger retains all its strength within the
progressively narrowing range of motion left to it
by the disease, and the utility of the hand may for
a long while be little impaired. Sooner or later
other fingers may become involved, and the affection
may appear in the opposite hand, to follow a
like course. The process of contraction is slow in
progress, perhaps extending over ten or twenty
years; it is painless, and is uncomplicated by any
signs of active inflammation. At length, after a
more or less protracted period, it may terminate
spontaneously in any of its stages, but the mischief
wrought is permanent, and unless the surgeon
intervenes, the patient carries it to his grave.</p>

<p>This is the more ordinary course, but the signs
show great variety in different cases. 1. The
disease may remain limited to the palm, not giving
rise to flexion of the finger; this is especially
frequent in women. 2. Any or all of the fingers
may be attacked, and the rigid bands may
implicate also the thenar and hypothenar eminences.
3. Either or both inter-phalangeal joints
may become flexed, while the metacarpo-phalangeal
joint remains free. 4. The palmar cord may
remain single and central, or it may send off a
lateral branch on either or both sides in the inter-digital
web, and so implicate two or three fingers.
5. A central band, after reaching the root of the
finger, may bifurcate, sending a branch to either<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
side of the digit; this, in my experience, is the
least common variety. 6. The cord, instead of
running along the central axis of the finger, may
pass towards the inter-digital cleft and then
divide, giving branches to two digits; a band of
this kind would be in dangerous relation to the
digital vessels and nerves in the event of operation
by excision. (<a href="#figure01">Fig. 1.</a>)</p>

<p>The statistics as to fingers affected in my series
of cases correspond closely to those already
published by Adams, Keen, and others. They
are as follows: Thumb, four times; index finger,
three times; middle finger, twenty-two times;
ring finger, thirty-nine times; little finger, twenty-eight
times (these numbers include the purely
palmar bands where they were placed over the
metacarpo-phalangeal articulation, but had not
yet led to contraction of the digit; traumatic
cases are excluded). The most common association
where more than one digit was affected was that
of the ring and little fingers; when a single finger
was attacked, it was most frequently the fourth.
The flexion involved in almost equal proportions
the metacarpo-phalangeal joint alone, and this
together with the first inter-phalangeal joint. In
four cases the first inter-phalangeal joint was
contracted, while the metacarpo-phalangeal articulation
was free, and in one case the distal joint
alone was flexed, although the band extended
from the palm. In only two cases were all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
fingers implicated. The condition was bilateral in
twenty-four cases out of thirty-nine, right-handed
in ten, and left-handed in five. Thus the right
hand was attacked thirty-four times, and the left
twenty-nine times. Of the twenty-four bilateral<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
cases, nine were worse in the right hand, six in
the left; in the rest the severity differed little
on the two sides. Nearly one-third were unsymmetrical
as to the fingers attacked. In eight
patients, six of whom were women, the band was
purely palmar, and did not cause any contraction
of the fingers.</p>

<p>Two interesting points to be especially noted in
reviewing the series were—first, the tendency to
multiplicity of the initial lesions; and, secondly,
the close coincidence of their position with that
of the heads of the metacarpal bones. In no case
did the disease commence in the finger itself.
These facts probably have a bearing upon etiology.
In only one instance was there any association
with a corresponding disease of the sole.</p>

<p>The inconveniences resulting from the affection
are less urgent than might have been expected,
partly because the flexion power remains, partly
because there is no pain, and partly because the
contraction seldom attains an aggravated form
until an age when æsthetic considerations are of
minor importance and the more active period of
working life is drawing to a close. In some extreme
cases, however, the nail of the contracted finger
may press against the palm, and cause ulceration,
and in one instance brought under my notice by a
friend the deformity was nearly the cause of a
fatal accident, the bent finger becoming hooked in
the handle of a moving railway carriage in such a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
manner that it could not be disengaged. The
patient saved himself by seizing a pillar, while the
traction force tore asunder the diseased fibrous
bands and set the straightened finger free. It is
needless to say that the benefit of the impromptu
operation was limited to the immediate service
rendered.</p>

<p>The <i>frequency</i> of the complaint is difficult to
estimate. With a view to forming some opinion
as to its prevalence in the poorer classes I took
advantage of the kindness of Mr. J. Lunn of the
Marylebone Infirmary, Mr. Percy Potter of the
Kensington Infirmary, Dr. A. H. Robinson of the
Mile End Infirmary, and Dr. S. G. Litteljohn of
the Central District Schools at Hanwell, to select
cases from the large body of patients in the
institutions under their control; and in the cases
of Kensington and Mile End I had also the privilege
of access to the workhouses in connection
with the infirmaries. The total numbers of the
persons thus open to investigation were 2600
adults, and 800 children under the age of sixteen.
All of these were carefully examined, and every
example of Dupuytren’s contraction (as well as of
the other conditions included in these lectures)
was systematically recorded. Of the 2600 adults,
of whom about five-sixths were over middle age,
33, or 1·27 per cent., were found to be suffering
from various stages of the affection, while in the
800 children no trace of the disease was to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
detected. This proportion is very much smaller
than that discovered by Mr. Noble Smith, who
was fortunate enough to detect no fewer than 70
examples in 700 persons. His facts and deductions
have been fully discussed at the Royal
Medical and Chirurgical Society and in the
medical papers.</p>

<p><i>Sex.</i>—The influence of sex is very noteworthy,
but much less than was formerly conjectured.
Cases of any degree of severity in the female are
rare, but the slighter forms are fairly common.
Of thirty-nine non-traumatic cases, twenty-five
were in men and fourteen in women, but of the
latter number in only eight was there any contraction
of the fingers. This proportion is larger on
the side of the female sex than that given by Dr.
Keen in the valuable series analysed by him in
1882 (20 females to 106 males); but it must be
pointed out that most of the cases in my list
would have escaped notice altogether without a
close examination of the palm.</p>

<p><i>Age.</i>—True Dupuytren’s contraction is almost
essentially a disease of middle or later life at its
onset. It was estimated by Dr. Keen that about
five-sixths of the cases began after the age of
thirty, but his examples included some of the
traumatic form, which may of course originate at
any period of life. In my own series only one, a
man of thirty-two, was below the age of forty
when the disease first appeared, and in the number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
seen in hospital practice before I began to keep
notes of the cases, I do not recollect one in which
the symptoms commenced in youth or early adult
life. My friend Surgeon-Captain A. H. De Lom,
has kindly obtained for me some statistics that
bear very directly upon this point. He finds by
reference to the Army Reports that in a force
averaging 203,000 soldiers, between the ages of
seventeen and thirty-five, only three cases of contraction
of the fingers came under treatment in
five years (1885-89), and it is not certain whether
these were of the traumatic or of the specific
variety. It is of course possible that some incipient
cases escaped attention, but the magnitude of the
figures gives a value to the record in spite of this
source of fallacy. It is stated, however, that
exceptions to the rule do occur, and that conditions
bearing a resemblance to true Dupuytren’s contraction
have been seen in childhood, and some of these
are even believed to be congenital; but it is
probable that a closer examination of such cases
would prove them to be of a different pathological
nature. There appears to be no limit to the period
of onset in the other direction. In eighteen cases
in my list the disease was unnoticed until after the
age of sixty, and in six of these it did not appear
until the eighth decade; and it is significant that
the majority of these patients, a portion of whom
were women, had given up laborious employment
before the symptoms appeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p><i>Class and occupation.</i>—It is very difficult to
obtain any information of statistical value as to
the proportionate distribution of the complaint in
the “classes” and “masses,” and there is great
difference of opinion upon the question amongst
our best authorities. It is at any rate certain that
our workhouses contain a considerable number of
examples, and that the disease is also very often
found in men and women of the educated ranks.
The same doubt exists with reference to the influence
of occupation, but there is no question that
the earlier observers greatly exaggerated the importance
of this factor. It appears, indeed, that in
various callings which involve much rough treatment
of the palm the affection is even less common
than in the rest of the community. Its infrequency
amongst soldiers has been already remarked, and
Mr. Johnson Smith informs me that it is very rare
amongst sailors. In about two hundred patients
at the Seamen’s Hospital, whom he was kind
enough to examine in order to put the question to
the test, only one example of the disease was
found, and this was probably of traumatic origin.
Shoemakers have been said to suffer frequently,
and for mechanical reasons, but there seems to be
no substantial foundation for the belief. I have
only met with one of the craft so affected, and by
a somewhat curious coincidence the disease was of
older date, and more severe in the left hand than
in the right. This man told me that he had never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
seen or heard of the complaint amongst his fellow
workmen. Two of the worst cases in my own
series were in clerks. With reference to the question
of occupation, it may be remembered that the
affection is bilateral in nearly two-thirds of the
cases, and that the left hand is affected almost as
frequently as the right—in my own cases in the
proportion of six to seven. This and the other
facts named would appear to negative the view
that mere friction and pressure of the palm by
tools or other objects habitually held within the
hands can account for the disease. On the contrary,
it is possible that habitual rough usage of
the hands, by leading to epidermic thickening,
protects the deeper structures; and that the
horny-handed toiler is proportionately less liable
to the disease than his more fortunate and more
tender-palmed fellow citizen. Nevertheless, when
the condition has once started it is likely that its
progress would be hastened by any external source
of irritation, and hence the strong conviction of
the sufferers as to the mechanical origin of their
deformity.</p>

<p><i>Constitutional condition.</i>—If a generalisation
would be permissible solely upon the cases in my
own list, I should be inclined to think that the
patients were rather above than below the average
in health. Twenty-six out of the thirty-nine had
passed threescore and ten when they came under
my notice, and with four exceptions all were in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
good physical condition, and one (a woman with
fairly well-marked contraction in both hands) had
reached the span of ninety-three years. In each
case careful inquiries were made with reference to
the inheritance or past or present existence of
gout, rheumatism, and rheumatoid arthritis, and
the result, confirmed as far as possible by direct
examination of the patients, was altogether contrary
to my preconceived notions on the subject.
Of the whole number, only one had suffered from
gout, one from rheumatic fever, three from rheumatoid
arthritis (all in women, whose Dupuytren’s
disease was limited to slight palmar lesion), and
six from mild subacute or chronic rheumatism. A
possible gouty inheritance was traced in three
cases. All were free from nervous disorders except
two of the women, who were subject to neuralgias
of an ordinary kind, and one (aged seventy-three)
with a double contraction of thirty years’ standing,
who was suffering from hemiplegia of three years’
duration. No complaint as to the digestive functions
was made in any case.</p>

<p>The evidence brought forward by different
observers with regard to constitutional tendency
appears to be extremely conflicting. Thus, Dr.
Keen, whose contribution is one of the most
careful records we possess, found no fewer than
forty-two gouty patients out of forty-eight cases;
and Mr. Adams expresses his opinion that the
disease is a gouty thickening of the palmar fascia.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
Dr. Abbe of New York, on the other hand, has
noticed a remarkable frequency of nervous symptoms
in connection with Dupuytren’s contraction,
and believes that the complaint is of neuropathic
origin, while other surgeons have in like manner
assigned to rheumatism, rheumatoid arthritis,
alcoholism, and other conditions an important
causative relation with the disease. There is, of
course, no doubt that such widespread affections
as gout and rheumatism, neuroses and alcoholism
are present in certain cases—it would be strange
were it not so; but it is noticeable that the writer
who gives a prominent place in the causation to
any one of these conditions always holds the claims
of the rest in very low esteem; and it appears
probable that the associated constitutional tendencies
noticed in the different groups of cases
depended rather upon the particular class or set
from which the observer drew his patients than
upon any essential connection between the local
and internal affections. My own experience of the
disease has been based principally upon cases in
hospitals, and hence the remarkable absence in my
series of the neurotic or gouty predispositions that
might have appeared in persons whose worldly circumstances
favoured either of those conditions.</p>

<p><i>Habits.</i>—In my inquiries as to habits, the usual
difficulty of obtaining trustworthy replies was
experienced. Three of the more severe cases
pleaded guilty to long-standing intemperance, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
the rest all regarded themselves as moderate
drinkers—an elastic term. There was, however,
nothing in their general condition to indicate that
alcoholism had exercised any material influence in
favouring the palmar lesion.</p>

<p><i>Race and climate.</i>—We have at present no
statistics with regard to the effects of race and
climate upon the disease; but so far as we are at
present informed it must be rare, if not altogether
absent, in certain countries. During my own
residence of six years in Japan I did not meet
with a single instance; and the far larger experience
of my friend Surgeon-General Takaki has
been equally negative as to this particular affection.
My friend Surgeon-Colonel Owen tells me that in
an extensive experience amongst the natives of
Bengal, Central Asia, and Afghanistan, he does
not recollect more than one or two cases, and that
these may have been traumatic. At any rate, the
condition is extremely rare.</p>

<p><i>Inheritance.</i>—There is unquestionably a strong
predisposition to the disease in certain individuals
and families, and so many examples of hereditary
transmission of the tendency have been related
that it is useless to add further to the list. We
can no more explain the cause of this special
predisposition than we can account for the idiosyncrasy
which renders certain persons inordinately
liable to erysipelas and some other affections; and
although Dupuytren’s contraction is often associated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
with such widespread complaints as gout,
rheumatism, and various neuroses, its relation
to these is probably to be regarded as a coincidence.</p>

<p><i>Morbid anatomy.</i>—It has long been a subject of
dispute whether the complaint is or is not a contraction
of the palmar fascia. There is, of course,
no doubt that the palmar fascia is always implicated
to some extent, but its exact relation to the
morbid tissue that constitutes the essence of
Dupuytren’s disease can only be decided by a
consideration of the anatomy of the healthy
structure.</p>

<p>It is perhaps not easy to say what is meant by
the expression “palmar fascia,” since the text-books
are by no means agreed upon the point.
We have really to notice four palmar structures
which may claim a share in the title. These are
(1) the radiating fascia, spreading towards the
fingers from the palmaris longus and annular
ligament; (2) the aponeuroses investing the
muscles of the thumb and fingers; (3) a delicate
connective tissue blending with 1 and 2 and
forming sheaths for the flexor tendons, the lumbricales,
and the digital vessels and nerves; (4) the
fascia of Gerdy, which runs transversely across the
bases of the second, third, fourth, and fifth fingers
and in the inter-digital webs, and is continuous
with the superficial fascia of the digits and dorsal
surface of the hand. Lastly, in addition to these,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
we might regard the ligamenta vaginalia and the
transverse ligaments connecting the metacarpo-phalangeal
articulations as specialisations of the
family. We are, however, mainly concerned with
the radiating fascia and fibres of Gerdy.</p>

<p>The <i>radiating fascia</i> consists of a strong fibrous
expansion extending subcutaneously from the
anterior annular ligament and palmaris longus
tendon, and consisting of an outer or thenar
portion, spreading over the muscles of the thumb
and blending with the muscular aponeurosis; an
inner or hypothenar portion similarly related to
the muscles of the little finger; and a central
digital expansion which is derived almost entirely
from the palmaris longus when this is present, but
is well developed even when the muscle is wanting.
The central portion spreads out in a fan-like
manner as it approaches the fingers, giving off
some strong fibres from its anterior surface through
the palmar fat to the connective tissue of the
superjacent corium, especially in the situation of
the palmar folds, and attached by its deep surface
to the delicate fascial investment surrounding
the tendons, vessels, and nerves; finally, a little
beyond the middle of the palm it divides into four
segments, one for each digit, each of which soon
breaks up into two lateral bands that embrace the
sides of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint to blend
with its ligaments and the periosteum of the
first phalanx, and running on become similarly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
connected with the first inter-phalangeal joint
and middle phalanx. Where the four digital
bands diverge they are joined together by deep
transverse fibres which pass from the inner to the
outer border of the hand, blending in these
situations with the muscular aponeurosis. (<a href="#figure02">Fig. 2.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>The <i>transverse fibres of Gerdy</i> are really the
proximal portion of a superficial fascia which
invests the whole of the four inner digits immediately
under the skin, forms the subcutaneous
web of the fingers, and is continuous posteriorly
with the superficial fascia of the back of the hand.
As seen in the palm, it consists of loose fibres
intermingled with fat, running for the most part
in a transverse direction from the second to the
fifth metacarpo-phalangeal joint. Proximally it
presents a somewhat sharply defined free border
placed nearly opposite the joint fissure, and
extends distally, as before stated, to the fingers
and the inter-digital web, and is connected with
the deeper tissues by a few fibres, but is for
the most part separated from them by loose,
whitish fat. On the fingers the tissue constitutes
a sheath investing the tendinous, bony, and
ligamentous structures and the lateral bands
derived from the radiating fascia. It takes the
form of a distinctly membranous sheet dorsally
and at the sides, but in front it appears as a
coarse irregular network supporting the digital
vessels and nerves, and containing a large quantity
of fat in its meshes. It is connected strongly
with the corium, especially at the palmar folds,
and more loosely with the deeper structures by
fine fibres.</p>

<p>Between the proximal border of the fibres of
Gerdy and the point of bifurcation of the digital<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
bands of the radiating fascia is a space about half
an inch in length, in which is seen a portion of
the <i>vaginal fascia</i> that invests the tendons,
vessels, and nerves in the palm. (<a href="#figure03">Fig. 3.</a>) The
connective-tissue fibres in this latter are for the
most part transversely arranged. They are connected
superficially with the deep surface of the
radiating fascia, where they lie beneath it, and
deeply with the aponeuroses of the interossei,
transverse metacarpal ligament, and glenoid plates,
and form septa between the flexor tendons of the
four fingers. Where they ensheath the tendons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
above the ligamenta vaginalia they are separated
from them by a kind of lymph space.</p>

<p>If we examine a case of Dupuytren’s contraction
in the light of our anatomical knowledge, we shall
be struck by the circumstance that the morbid
structure which causes the permanent flexion of
the fingers bears no resemblance in position or
character to the normal fibrous tissues of the part,
although it is apparently continuous in the proximal
direction with the digital bands of the radiating
fascia. The band is best developed beyond
the point where the radiating fascia normally
ceases, and maintains its longitudinal fibrillation
while crossing the vaginal fascia and the transverse
fibres of Gerdy. The varieties and modes
of branching already described are only to a limited
extent related to the anatomical arrangements—that
is, where the morbid tissue spreads proximally
over the radiating fascia, and sends lateral branches
along the course of Gerdy’s fibres; but it is certain
that the tendon-like cords are of entirely new
formation, and that they exist at the expense of
the normal structures. The well-known preparation
in St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, which has been
figured by Mr. Adams, affords a demonstration of
this, as the band, instead of following the direction
of the radiating fascia, runs towards the inter-digital
cleft and there bifurcates, sending branches
to the adjacent sides of two fingers. In a specimen
of my own the band runs axially to the little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
finger and spreads out in front of the first phalanx
as a fatless fan-like expansion, that differs altogether
in character and arrangement from the
normal subcutaneous tissue and becomes closely
connected with the skin, the structure of which,
however, remains unchanged. The firmest point
of integumental adhesion is opposite the distal
flexion fold over the head of the fifth metacarpal
bone. The first phalanx is flexed to about 90°,
and over the metacarpo-phalangeal joint the contracted
cord lies in a plane considerably anterior
to the tendons, vessels, and nerves, all of which
maintain their normal relation to the bones and
muscles. There is no tendency on the part of the
morbid growth to follow the deep connections of
the fascia in the palm.</p>

<p>The radiating fascia, and perhaps even the
tendon of the palmaris longus, are made tense
and prominent by the shrinking of the new
material, but the palmaris longus has no primary
share in the production of the deformity, and
in fact the disease may be present where the
muscle is undeveloped. Repeated experience in
operations has proved that the flexor tendons are
not affected, and that even in long-standing cases
the joints may be fully extended immediately
after the division of the morbid fibrous bands. It
may be accepted as a principle that the development
of a tendon once completed, the tissue has
little or no disposition to retrograde changes in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
the direction of its length. When the most prominent
parts of the contracted cords are exposed
for excision they bear much resemblance to tendon
in contour and striation, but they are less bluish
and lustrous in aspect. On dissecting them away
from the radiating fascia the transverse fibres
interlocking the digital segments of the latter
may often be seen unchanged, and in one case in
which the disease had attacked the sole the new
fibrous tissue could easily be detached from the
fascial fibres, which retained all their lustre.</p>

<p>The histological appearances of the new growth
are those of fibrous tissue. If the disease is
spreading, the fibrous strands are intermingled
with nuclear proliferation, which extends especially
along the course of the vessels.</p>

<p><i>Pathology.</i>—The study of the character and
relations of the diseased structure indicates that it
is an inflammatory hyperplasia commencing in the
skin and subcutaneous tissue of the palm, involving
the fascia secondarily, and replacing the adipose
connective tissue which normally serves as an
elastic cushion for the palmar surface of the hand
and fingers. It must now be considered what is
the cause of the morbid process. The view of
Dupuytren has already been referred to. He
believed that the affection was provoked by
repeated injuries of the palmar fascia by pressure
and friction from implements used habitually in
different mechanical callings; but the facts I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
adduced in the discussion of the etiology conflict
strongly with the hypothesis. It has been shown
that in artisans both hands may be equally affected
where only one is brought in contact with the tool,
that aggravated forms of contractions may appear
in persons who are not at all exposed to any such
habitual source of irritation, and, moreover, that
the disease appears to be of less than average
frequency in certain employments in which the
palms are subject to an unusual degree of friction.</p>

<p>Some source of irritation, however, must be
present, and it has been suggested that this is to
be found in gouty deposits. In one case recently
brought forward by Mr. Lockwood, uric acid
crystals were actually present in connection with
the bands; but this experience is exceptional.
That the new tissue might become the seat of such
a deposit in gouty subjects is more than probable,
but in the majority of cases of Dupuytren’s contraction
seen in this country the patients are not,
and have not been, subject to gout. It would,
moreover, be difficult to find any condition that
presents less resemblance in its course and tendencies
to known manifestations of the gouty
poison. The changes, indeed, are much more
suggestive of chronic rheumatism than gout, but
even the probability of this source of origin is not
supported by observed facts. The situation of the
initial lesions, and the peculiar tendency of the
new growth to feed like a parasite upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
tissues in which it spreads and which it replaces
have led me to believe strongly that the active
cause of the disease is a chronic inflammation
probably set up by a micro-organism, which gains
access to the subcutaneous tissue through
accidental lesions of the epidermis overlying the
bony prominences formed by the heads of the
metacarpal bones. This would explain better
than any existing hypothesis the persistent course
of the disease and its proneness to recur after the
most skillfully devised operation, while the almost
constant limitation of the disease to the declining
years of life corresponds mainly to lessened resistance
in the bodily organism, and partly perhaps to
senile absorption of the palmar fat cushion and
atrophy of the protective thickening of the
epidermis. The almost complete immunity of
the foot is accounted for by the protection afforded
by the shoes and stockings. Individual and inherited
susceptibilities are exemplified here as in
other complaints of known bacterial origin. To
determine the question I have sought the experienced
aid of my colleague, Mr. Shattock, in carrying
out a series of bacteriological researches.</p>

<p>In a patient in whom it was decided to excise
the contracted tissue in two hands the more
recently affected member was selected for experiment.
The skin was incised under strict antiseptic
precautions, portions of the growing tissue were
cut away with the aid of a knife and forceps,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
sterilised by heat immediately before use, and the
fragments excised were at once placed in cultivating
tubes of agar-agar and gelatine. In a second
case a commencing nodule upon the plantar fascia
of a patient, suffering also from Dupuytren’s
contraction of the hands, was treated in a similar
manner. In Case 1 two of the three fragments
quickly showed a growth obviously due to contamination.
On the third and fourth days a
yellow nodule appeared in all three specimens,
and on cultivation assumed a form which led us
to believe that a specific organism had been
isolated; but on making a cover-glass preparation
of this it proved to be merely a form of yellow
sarcina. In the jelly tube containing one of the
original pieces of tissue, and in the agar tube a second
growth, <i>micrococcus candidans</i>, subsequently
developed, and a like growth appeared in Case 2.
It is desirable that these experiments should be
repeated; but it must not be assumed that
negative evidence necessarily disproves the agency
of organisms; partly because our present means
of detection are not yet perfected, and partly
because the tissue examined may merely offer the
result of a morbid process that has already come
to a natural termination. Sections from Case 1
stained with fuchsin and by Gram’s method
showed no organisms as viewed under 1/12 homogeneous
immersion.</p>

<p><i>False Dupuytren’s contraction.</i>—There is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
form of digital contraction usually classed with
that just described, but differing from it in origin
and several other respects. It is always due to
obvious traumatisms, such as incised or lacerated
wounds, involving the palmar or digital fascia.
The age at which the lesion begins is governed by
the period of injury, and hence the condition is as
common in childhood and early adult life as in
middle or old age. The seat of initial lesion is
single, and the affection is confined to the injured
hand, not tending to appear subsequently in other
parts of the same hand or in the opposite member,
as in most examples of the ordinary form. The
contraction progresses rapidly to a certain point,
and then ceases to get worse. It rarely becomes
so strongly marked as in the worst cases of the
true Dupuytren’s disease. The contracted band,
starting from the point of injury (which is indicated
by an ordinary scar) has seldom the
tendon-like form of the well-marked “Dupuytren,”
the characteristic puckers in the skin are represented
only by ordinary cicatricial adhesions, and
the digital extensions are usually in the form of
one or two lateral bands following the bifurcation
of the digital process of the radiating fascia.
Lastly, the effect of operation is different. Subcutaneous
division is less efficacious when the skin
is extensively implicated in the cicatrix, and the
excision of the band or the transplantation of a
flap after division of the cicatrix is not followed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
the strong tendency to recurrence observable after
similar proceedings in the true form. In all the
seven cases in my list the nature and traumatic
origin of the disease could be recognised without
difficulty.</p>

<p>A subcutaneous cicatricial contraction of the
finger may also result from violent and sudden
super-extension of the joint. The lateral bands
extending from the radiating fascia are ruptured,
and if the finger is not kept straight by mechanical
appliances a contraction of the joint is liable to
occur. In such cases the resistance to extension
is felt to depend upon two tense lateral bands,
while the movements of the articulation in the
direction of flexion remain strong and normal.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>—Some eighty years ago Baron
Boyer, speaking of the disease now under consideration,
said that it had been advised to expose
and divide the contracted tendon, and even
to excise a portion, afterwards keeping the hand
extended upon a splint; but, he remarks, “Le
succès d’une telle opération est trop incertain;
elle n’a probablement jamais été pratiquée et un
chirurgeon prudent devra toujours s’en abstenir.”
It was he who expressed the congratulatory belief
that surgery had already in his day reached its
final limits, and all that had then not been accomplished
could scarcely be regarded as attainable.
For many years after his time it cannot be said
that the treatment made any real progress. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
true that Sir Astley Cooper advised subcutaneous
section of the contracted bands, but the suggestion
was not carried into practice till much later, when
Dupuytren, having decided that the tendons were
not affected, did what Boyer considered unpermissible,
cut the contracted cords and superjacent
integument, and straightened the hand upon a
splint. The results appeared to fully justify the
remarks of his predecessor, for under this treatment
the gaping wound suppurated; and if the
patient recovered without loss of the hand the
process of cicatrisation at length restored the
deformity in a more hopeless and distressing form
than before. A few years afterwards Goyrand
recommended an improved method: that of
exposing the tense bridle of morbid tissue by a
longitudinal incision, dividing it, and then reuniting
the edges of the cutaneous wound; and
this plan was adopted with various modifications
by other surgeons. The absence of antiseptic
precautions, however, exposed the wound to all
the dangers of infection, and as the treatment
mostly failed to secure the advantage hoped for it
fell into disrepute, and patients were usually
dissuaded by their friends, and even by their
medical attendants, from submitting to any operative
measures. It is to Jules Guérin that we are
indebted for the first demonstration of the value
of the subcutaneous method proposed by Sir
Astley Cooper, and the practice was carried out in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
this country by Messrs. Tamplin and Lonsdale,
and perfected by Mr. William Adams. For a
time the subcutaneous operation held its ground
without a rival, but the introduction of the antiseptic
principle in surgery rendered it possible to
reconsider the discredited open method, and the
plan was revived with various modifications by
Kocher, Busch, Hardie, and others, with encouraging
though variable results.</p>

<p>The therapeutical measures now eligible may be
briefly enumerated:</p>

<p><i>Non-operative treatment.</i>—There is no doubt
that in the milder cases and when the morbid
process has come to a standstill, a considerable
improvement may be effected by massage and
persevering extension. I have seen in a patient
of seventy the fourth and fifth fingers brought
from an angle of 90° with the palm nearly to a
straight line within a year, but the contraction
relapsed completely in three months, when a
severe illness made it necessary to suspend the
treatment.</p>

<p>We have heard much of the wonders effected
by hypnotism during the latter days, but the
surgeon hardly expected to be told that Dupuytren’s
contraction, of all diseases, could be cured
by “suggestion.” Yet in a recent volume of one
of our medical journals we find a practitioner
gravely claiming a successful result for this treatment
in a case of the kind; a curious demonstration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
of the survival, at the end of the nineteenth
century, of the peculiar mental condition that
brought patients to the feet of Greatrakes and
Perkins in a bygone generation.</p>

<p>The <i>Operative measures</i> may be divided into
three classes: subcutaneous, open, and plastic.</p>

<p>The <i>Subcutaneous method</i> deserves the first
place. Mr. Adams’s operation consists in the
subcutaneous division of all the contracted bands
of fascia which can be felt; “the bands to be
divided by several punctures with the smallest
fascia knife passed under the skin and cutting
from above downwards, followed by immediate
extension to the full extent required for the
complete straightening of the fingers when this is
possible, and the application of a retentive, well-padded,
metal splint from the wrist along the
palm of the hand and fingers; the fingers and
hand to be bandaged to the splint. When the
full extension cannot be safely made, it must be
carried as far as possible without tearing the skin.”
This plan I have followed, with slight variations,
but I have found it easier, after making the
preliminary puncture (which should be longitudinal
in direction to prevent gaping during the subsequent
extension), to pass the knife beneath the
band and to cut from within outwards, except in
places where the deep surface of the skin is very
tightly adherent, and the little wounds are sealed
with cotton wool impregnated with collodion and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
dusted over with iodoform. The sensation conveyed
to the operator by the division of the round
palmar cords is very similar to that experienced
in tenotomy, and the effect of each section is
immediate and encouraging. In some examples,
however, the morbid tissue has become so firmly
blended with the corium, especially over the
proximal phalanx, that a satisfactory division is
difficult, or even impossible; and if the extension
be carried too far ominous fissures begin to appear
in the rigid integument. When this happens the
surgeon, if wise, will be satisfied with whatever
he has been able to achieve, without proceeding
further at the time. The splint extension may be
immediate or deferred. Where the skin has held
good there is no reason why the fingers should
not be put in position at once and fixed in place
by a splint of plaster of Paris or other material;
but if it be evident that the integument at any
point has been severely strained, it is desirable to
wait for a few days before the parts are put on
the stretch, and there is no reason to believe that
the delay will be attended by any disadvantage.
The operation may with benefit be preceded by
careful washing of the hand and packing with a
weak solution of perchloride of mercury solution
or other antiseptic, and antiseptic dressings should
be applied until the incisions are completely
healed.</p>

<p>The after-treatment consists in the use of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
splints of various forms. The palmar splints of
Mr. Adams are very convenient, but in the early
periods plaster of Paris is equally satisfactory,
and renders the intervention of the instrument-maker
unnecessary. Whatever form be adopted
it should be worn day and night for two or three
weeks, and then be replaced by a well-moulded
front splint of sheet iron, to be applied at night
only, and kept in use for several months. The
hand once set free during the day the patient is
to be urged to practise friction, with passive
extension and active movements of the joint, at
every possible opportunity; and it is only by
strict attention to these rules that permanency of
the improvement can be ensured. In private
practice the instructions are usually carried out
with a good will, and hence relapses are exceptional.
Mr. Adams and Mr. Macready estimate
them as less than ten per cent. But in hospital
practice the case is different. The artisan has
seldom much leisure or inclination for unpleasant
manipulations for which, despite the assurances of
the surgeon, he sees little immediate necessity,
and he frequently allows the hand to drift into a
condition, which, if not worse, is at least little
better than before.</p>

<p>The <i>Open operations</i> may be placed under two
separate headings—one in which the bands are
merely divided in one or two places, and the
other in which the morbid tissue is excised as far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
as possible. The first of these, however—the
original method of Goyrand—may now be held as
superseded, since it has neither the safety of the
subcutaneous method nor the thoroughness of the
more radical measure. We need therefore only
discuss the latter. The cutaneous incision may
be either longitudinal and linear, as practised by
Goyrand, Kocher, and others, or V- or Y-shaped,
after the method of Busch, Madelung, and Richer.
In any case the reflected skin should be very
gently dealt with, and the wound carefully closed
after the removal of the diseased bands. In most
instances the simple linear incision gives all that
is required, but the other varieties are useful when
the distal end of the band branches or expands.
The isosceles flap of Busch is made with the base
opposite the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, the apex
at the distal extremity of the hollow of the palm.
(<a href="#figure04">Fig. 4.</a>) When the hand is extended after
section or excision of the contracted tissue the
apex of the flap is drawn away from the angle of
the incision, and the wound when closed assumes
a Y-shape. A Y-incision, with the fork over the
first phalanx, and the stem corresponding to the
palmar cord, is of advantage where the fibrous
band spreads out broadly and becomes adherent
to the skin beyond the metacarpo-phalangeal
joint, the reflection of the angular flap within the
fork allowing the safe removal of the diseased
tissue. In any of these operations the anatomical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
relations of the vessels and nerves should be carefully
borne in mind. Fortunately the morbid
tissue seldom encroaches upon the nerve tracts in
such a way as to expose them to danger. The
best rule for the surgeon is to confine his dissection
as far as possible to the tissue overlying the axes
of the flexor tendons, and not to make any further
lateral excursion than is absolutely necessary.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
Extreme care, however, will always be needed in
excising cords which run towards the inter-digital
web, as these lie directly over the nerves.
The tendons are quite safe in the palmar incisions,
as they lie much deeper than the fibrous cords,
but the diseased tissue is closely related to the
thecæ in the fingers. The after-treatment is
similar to that recommended for the subcutaneous
operation, but for obvious reasons the necessity for
antiseptic precautions is more vital in the open
method. No drainage is required.</p>

</figure>

<p><i>Plastic operations</i> may be conducted under the
same principles as those which guide the surgeon
in the treatment of cicatricial contractions from
burns or other causes. In cases of contraction at
the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, where the skin
is greatly involved, I have made a transverse incision
through the integument and fibrous cord at
the root of the finger and filled up the wide gap
left on extending the joint by the transplantation
of a flap from the side of the digit. (<a href="#figure05">Fig. 5.</a>) The
dissection of the flap must be carefully conducted
in order to avoid injury to the digital nerves. The
result is usually good and permanent. In some
cases it might be permissible to carry the plastic
principle still further by the transplantation of a
flap on the Tagliacotian principle from the chest
or upper arm or any other convenient point; or
the more simple resource of grafting, after the
manner of Thiersch, may be employed with advantage,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
as it has been proved to have a remarkable
effect in lessening cicatricial contraction.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp58" id="figure05" style="max-width: 21.875em;">

<p class="sub">Diagram showing lateral flap transplanted into gap left by
division of the contracted band, with the superjacent integument
at the level of the inter-digital web.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Of these various procedures I believe that the
best operation in most cases is the subcutaneous
plan. It is speedy and safe, the immediate results
are very satisfactory, the risks of relapse are in
my experience less than in the open method, and
in the event of a recurrence the other lines of
treatment are still available. The open operation
involves a more extensive surgical injury, and
although it will usually do well under antiseptic
precautions, there is a greater risk of casualties.
It is perhaps most applicable to the slighter cases,
in which the whole of the disease can be removed,
but it may also be employed where the subcutaneous
plan has failed. The plastic operations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
are most useful in the traumatic forms, and in
those cases of true Dupuytren’s contraction where
the skin is so far involved that full or satisfactory
extension is impossible. The method I have suggested
produces an immediate result, and under
ordinary circumstances a long after-treatment is
unnecessary, because the flap of integument does
not tend to contract. The larger operation can
only be called for in very severe cases, where all
other measures have failed.</p>

<p>It is not certain in any given example whether
the surgeon will be successful in giving lasting
relief to the patient. Were it simply a question
of dividing or excising a common cicatricial band,
there is no reason why the result of every well-devised
operation should not be permanent; but
experience shows that even with the greatest care
it is occasionally difficult to prevent a return of
the condition which gave rise to the deformity
in the first place—that is, a growth of new fibrous
tissue which tends to contract.</p>

<p>The main conclusions arrived at may be stated
as follows:</p>

<p>1. There are two forms of disease comprised
under the name “contraction of the palmar fascia,”
the one traumatic in origin, occurring at all ages,
and not tending to spread far beyond the seat
of injury; the other unassociated with obvious
traumatism, tending to multiplicity of lesion, and
almost confined to middle and advanced life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>2. The latter condition, the true “Dupuytren’s
contraction,” is not, strictly speaking, a contraction
of the palmar fascia, but consists of a chronic inflammatory
hyperplasia, commencing in the corium
and subcutaneous connective tissue, involving
secondarily the palmar fasciæ, and tending to the
formation of dense bands of cicatricial tissue which
replace the normal structure.</p>

<p>3. It does not appear to be especially connected
with pressure or friction of the palm by tools or
other objects employed in manual occupations, but
is probably caused by infective organisms which
gain admission through epidermic lesions, usually
located over the prominent heads of the metacarpal
bones.</p>

<p>4. It is almost essentially a disease of middle
and advanced age, more common in men than in
women, occurring in all classes, tending to progress
slowly through a long course of years, and liable
to recurrence after operation.</p>

<p>5. It is connected with a special susceptibility,
inherited or acquired, which cannot yet be
accounted for or expressed in any known terms;
but neither gout, rheumatism, rheumatoid arthritis,
nor any other of the ordinary constitutional ailments
has been proved to have any causative relation
to the disease.</p>

<p>6. Cicatricial deformities of the digits resulting
from burns and other severe injuries are often of
a very distressing character, and especially those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
which prevent opposition of the thumb to the
fingers. When the joints are not destroyed, the
utility of the member may generally be restored
by well-devised plastic measures, the new material
being either an epidermic graft, or a skin flap
taken from a convenient portion of the surface;
but it is useless to lay down laws in detail for the
treatment of these conditions, as the variations in
the extent and position of the loss of substance
are so great that only the ingenuity of the
operator can guide him in the application of the
general principles of plastic surgery.</p>

<h3 id="I_II">CONTRACTION OF THE FINGERS DUE TO DEVELOPMENTAL
IRREGULARITIES IN THE BONY AND
LIGAMENTOUS ELEMENTS OF THE ARTICULATIONS.</h3>

<p>There are certain affections of the fingers which
have hitherto attracted little notice, but are
interesting on account of their relationship
to deformities of much greater frequency in
the lower extremity. These are conditions of
abnormal flexion and of lateral deviation of the
phalanges at the inter-phalangeal articulations,
the first of which corresponds exactly to the well-known
deformity of the foot called “hammer toe.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure06" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure06.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="main"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span></p>
  <p class="main">“Hammer Finger.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“<i>Hammer finger</i>” (<a href="#figure06">Fig. 6</a>) is not a rare complaint,
although much less familiar, possibly
because much less troublesome, than hammer
toe. It may be defined as a permanent flexure
of one or more digits, nearly always at the
first or second inter-phalangeal joint, and unassociated
with inflammatory or degenerative disease
in the articular structures, or with any evidence
of paralytic or spastic phenomena in the muscles.
It is strictly limited in onset to the developmental
period, and may manifest itself at any time
between birth and adult life, possibly even before
birth in some instances. It is more common in
girls than in boys. The digit most frequently
attacked is the little finger, and the proximal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
inter-phalangeal joint is more often affected than
the distal joint. It is usually symmetrical. The
contraction is slow, progressive, and painless, and
becomes arrested spontaneously at any degree of
flexion, but seldom goes beyond an angle of 90°.
The joint cannot be extended by any ordinary
force except in the earliest stage, and even then
the bent position is immediately resumed after the
cessation of the effort. Flexion, on the other
hand, is complete and of fair power. No alteration
is produced in the deformity by flexion of the
wrist, a fact which proves that the main obstacle
to extension does not lie in the tendons. There
are no contracted fascial bands, and, as a rule, the
skin is normal, but occasionally a small longitudinal
fold may be present in the angle of flexion. In
rare instances the resistance to extension is capable
of yielding suddenly with a spring-like action, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
a similar movement recurs as the joint is replaced
in the position of flexion. These cases are usually
classed with the condition known as “trigger
finger.” The contraction also occurs in the metacarpo-phalangeal
joint, but very rarely attains a
degree marked enough to attract the attention of
patient or surgeon. In 800 children examined at
the Central District School at Hanwell by Dr.
Litteljohn and myself, this affection was found
seven times—five times in girls, twice in boys, the
ages of the subjects ranging between eight and
fourteen. In all these the deformity was confined
to the little finger, and in six cases it was bilateral.
The proximal inter-phalangeal joint was affected
in ten, and the distal joint in three of the thirteen
digits. The angle of flexion measured from the
prolonged metacarpal axis, ranged between 20°
and 80° in the different cases. A contraction of
less than 20° was frequent, but the deformity was
so slight that the cases were not recorded as pathological.
Besides these examples, I have met with
several cases in adult women, in whom the defect
is said to have originated in early childhood. The
little finger was affected in all, but in one the ring
finger, and in another the ring and middle fingers
were also involved. Only the last was unilateral.
The following case may serve as a type of the
more troublesome forms:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>G. B., a domestic servant, aged twenty-two, was admitted
into St. Thomas’s Hospital in June 1889, with contraction of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
the third, fourth, and fifth fingers of the right hand at the first
inter-phalangeal joints. The patient, a strong, healthy girl,
quite free from neurotic tendencies, stated that her little and
ring fingers had been contracted from early childhood, and that
the condition had increased slowly but progressively to the
present time. The middle finger became similarly affected
about five months before admission. She had never suffered
from pain, and the parts had been free from all sign of inflammation;
the deformity, however, caused very great inconvenience
in her occupation. Two months before admission an
attempt had been made to relieve the flexion of the little finger
by subcutaneous section of the fascia, with the result of inducing
a traumatic contraction of the metacarpo-phalangeal joint. The
family history was negative. On examination the little finger
was found to be flexed at an angle of 90° at the first inter-phalangeal
joint, and the metacarpo-phalangeal joint was bent
at an angle of 120° by cicatricial contraction of the skin and
subcutaneous tissue (the result of the operation alluded to).
The ring finger was flexed at the first inter-phalangeal joint
to about 110°, and the middle finger at the corresponding
articulation to about 150°. In the case of the inter-phalangeal
joints, the movements in the direction of flexion were quite
free and of normal power, but extension was strongly resisted
by ligamentous tension at the points named. No increase in
the range of movement was gained by flexion of the wrist. A
first operation was undertaken for the relief of the cicatricial
contraction at the proximal joint of the little finger. The tense
integumental band was divided, and after straightening the
joint a flap was dissected from the ulnar side of the digit
opposite the point of incision and twisted into the gap.
(<a href="#figure04">Fig. 4.</a>) The wound united by first intention, and the result
was permanent. A week later an operation was performed
upon the first inter-phalangeal articulation of the same finger.
The lateral ligaments were divided subcutaneously near their
proximal attachment, and it was found that the joint could
then be straightened by the use of moderate force; but on the
discontinuance of the extension the contraction was reproduced
by the elastic tension of the flexor, except during flexion of
the wrist. The hand was placed upon a splint. The patient,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
who did not bear restraint well, left the hospital, and has since
been lost sight of.</p>

</div>

<p>There is little doubt that in this case the primary
contraction was due to imperfect evolution of the
ligaments, and that the shortening of the tendons
was secondary. The reason for accepting this
order of phenomena is that a pure myogenic contraction
does not readily lead to changes in the
joint structures, because the articulations are
capable of full extension while the flexor tendons
are relaxed by bending the wrist, and hence the
limitation of movement is not constant. (See Case
recorded on <a href="#Page_58">page 58</a>.) On the other hand, in a
permanent contraction of a finger-joint occurring
during the period of active growth the flexors are
never stretched to their full extent, and consequently
do not undergo their normal longitudinal
development; but should such a contraction originate
in an adult the case is different, as muscle
and tendon show very little disposition to undergo
active involution in the direction of their length
after their complete development is attained; and
hence after division of the abnormal bands in true
Dupuytren’s disease the tendons do not impede
the complete extension of the digit. This law,
that joint contractions commencing in youth lead
to shortness of muscle tendon, while those beginning
in adult life do not, is worthy of the attention
of the surgeon.</p>

<p><i>Pathology.</i>—The affection is of some pathological<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
importance, because it affords a simple test case by
which many other questions of larger moment may
be decided. It has been demonstrated that the
permanent obstacle to extension of the contracted
joint is to be found in the ligaments, there is no
evidence of either muscular or nervous impairment
or of any inflammatory changes in or about the
joint, the process of contraction is slow and
painless, and the condition always originates and
progresses to its maximum during the term of
active growth. In order to understand the significance
of the complaint, it is necessary to dwell
upon some facts in digital anatomy and physiology
that have not received the consideration they
deserve. If we examine a number of hands, it will
be found that there is a remarkable wide physiological
variation in the range of movement at the
phalangeal articulations in different individuals,
and it requires but a small departure outside the
physiological limits of variation to constitute the
pathological deformity under consideration. The
results of my own observations are as follows: (1)
At each of the digital joints the distal bone, starting
from the position of extreme flexion, passes
through a variable number of degrees before it
reaches the point at which it is arrested by tension
of the ligaments. In the metacarpo-phalangeal
joint the angle formed between the two bones
during extreme flexion is usually about 80°, and
the entire extending movement from this point<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
may be represented in the healthy hand by any
number of degrees between 90 and 190. That is,
in one person the motion is arrested a little before
the axis of the phalanx reaches a line with that of
the metacarpal bone; in another it may be possible
to continue the extension until the two bones form
an angle with a dorsal opening of 90°. At the
first inter-phalangeal joint there is a similar but
less extensive variation. The extreme flexion
angle is 60° or 70°, and the full extension may be
checked as soon as the axes of the two bones are
in the same line (frequently a little before this
point is reached), or may be carried on 30° beyond.
In the distal joint the flexion angle is about 80°,
and extension may be checked when the two bones
are in the same line, or may be capable of continuation
for 40° or more. In the thumb the
range of movement at the metacarpo-phalangeal
joint varies from 80° to 170°, and at the inter-phalangeal
joint from 90° to 120°, in different
persons—i.e., the physiological variation in the
two articulations is 90° and 30° respectively. The
diagram (<a href="#figure07">Fig. 7</a>) may help to render this clear. It
is not only in different individuals that such
variations are apparent, but the fingers of the
same hand and corresponding fingers in opposite
hands may differ from each other to a marked
degree in range of extension. The super-extension
is usually greatest in childhood, and undergoes
great diminution as adult life is approached,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
although in many cases it is persistent; as a rule,
however, the limitation is in direct proportion to the
strength of the hand, and is hence nearly always
greater in the left hand than in the right. These
peculiarities are matters of common observation,
and popular expressions have ever been coined to
represent the extremes in the range of variation.
Thus a person who is able to bend his joints backwards
to a conspicuous degree is said to be
“double-jointed,” and one who cannot extend
them beyond the straight line is called “stiff-jointed”;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
and it is well known that “double-jointedness”
and “stiff-jointedness” run in
families, and in some cases may be traced through
several generations. In the author, for example,
the metacarpo-phalangeal joints of the index and
middle fingers of the right hand are “stiff,” while
those of the left are capable of a super-extension
of 45° beyond the metacarpal axis; and precisely
the same condition was present in his father, and
has been transmitted to his son.</p>

</figure>

<p>It may be of advantage to describe the articular
structures of one of the finger-joints somewhat in
detail. The capsule of an inter-phalangeal joint
is formed on the dorsal aspect by the expansion of
the extensor tendon, reinforced by the transverse
fibres (the <i>ligamenta dorsalia</i> of Henle), which
bind the tendon to the bone and lateral ligaments;
on the palmar surface of the articulation is a
glenoid plate of fibro-cartilage firmly attached to
the anterior border of the distal bone, but very
feebly connected with the neck of the proximal
bone, and fused intimately with the anterior fibres
of the lateral ligaments; lastly, at the sides of the
joints are the radial and ulnar lateral ligaments,
the attachment of which it is important to study
closely, as they are often imperfectly described in
anatomical text-books. The fibres of each lateral
ligament are attached above to a little tubercle at
the side of the head of the first phalanx, and from
this point they radiate in a fan-like manner—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
more posterior passing to the side of the base of
the second phalanx, the rest blending with the
glenoid plate, and through the intermediation of
this are connected with the anterior border of the
base of the distal bone, decussating to some
extent with fibres of the opposite ligament.
(<a href="#figure07">Fig. 7, <span class="allsmcap">C</span>.</a>) The strongest part of the glenoid
plate, in fact, is made up of these ligamentous
fibres; and it is these which, relaxed in flexion,
become progressively more and more stretched
during extension, and at length by their tension
bring the movement to a close, but, as already
shown, the point at which the maximum tension
is reached varies to a large extent in different
individuals.</p>

<p>The physiological variations in the range of
movements are thus to be explained by variations
in the relative length of the anterior fibres
of the lateral ligaments. The ideal constitution
of a joint depends upon the existence of a
certain ratio between the growth of bone and that
of ligament. Should the ligaments grow in excess,
their redundant length will permit great super-extension,
and may even cease to check the movement;
but if the bone grow relatively faster than
the ligaments, the anterior portion of the latter
will the sooner become tense during extension, and
where this disproportion is exceptionally great
the motion may be checked before it attains
physiological completeness, the result being a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
“hammer finger.” Irregularities of development
are most likely to occur in those joints which, for
one or other reason, have the least functional
activity. In the hand the little finger is much
less powerful than its fellows; and in association
with this it may often be noticed that the fourth
tendon of the flexor sublimis is reduced to a mere
thread; in the foot the same thing is observed in
the corresponding digit, but in a more marked
degree, and it is the degenerate little toe which is
most liable to the “hammer deformity.”</p>

<p>We may then define hammer finger as the result
of a developmental irregularity of the first or
second inter-phalangeal joint (rarely of the metacarpo-phalangeal
joint) by which the anterior
fibres of the lateral ligaments become prematurely
tense during extension, and so check that movement
before it attains its normal physiological
limit. It is precisely analogous to hammer toe;
but it is of less frequency than the latter affection,
because while civilisation sedulously cultivates the
freedom and precision of action in the fingers, it
devises foot-coverings to repress the natural play
of the toes. The tendency to the deformity may
be transmitted by descent through an indefinite
number of generations.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>—Spurious hammer finger, like false
hammer toe, may occur from—(1) articular lesions
due to rheumatism, rheumatoid arthritis, gout,
tuberculosis, and inflammations of traumatic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
origin; or (2) from interference with the muscular
functions by paralysis of the extensors or by
spastic contraction of the flexors. In the first
group the joint will be found in a more or less
complete state of ankylosis, movements in all
directions being impeded. In the second group
the articulation, although contracted, is freely
mobile under passive force, unless, as in some congenital
paralyses, irregularities of development in
the articulations be superadded.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>—The treatment of hammer finger is
a far less simple problem than that of hammer toe,
because in the toe the sacrifice of the movement of
the affected articulation does not sensibly impair
the utility of the digit, while in the fingers an
ankylosis of the first inter-phalangeal joint in the
position of either flexion or extension would be
even more inconvenient than the ligamentous contraction.
The measures available are (1) passive
movement; (2) subcutaneous section of lateral
ligaments, with or without tendon lengthening;
and (3) amputation. In the milder cases a persevering
use of passive motion will in time effect a
cure; but when the contraction has reached an
advanced degree it may be impossible to make an
impression by this means. We may then divide
the lateral ligaments, and keep the fingers straight
by means of an extension splint while the tendons
are relaxed by flexion of the wrist, trusting to
subsequent massage and passive motion, or, failing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
this, to tendon lengthening (by a process to be
described later), to overcome the resistance of the
shortened muscles. Section of tendons within the
theca is useless, because no uniting material is
thrown out between the divided ends. As a last
resource, amputation may be demanded to remove
a useless and inconvenient member.</p>

<p><i>Lateral versions of the phalangeal joints.</i>—Lateral
versions of the fingers are intimately associated
with hammer finger in pathology, and the
two distortions are sometimes combined. The
lateral inclination, which seldom exceeds 25°, may
affect either of the inter-phalangeal joints, but is
more frequently in the distal phalanx. Like the
“hammer” deformity, it is usually found in the
little finger, and is symmetrical. The version is
nearly always towards the radial side, and the
movements of the joint are a little impaired.
Amongst eight hundred children in the Hanwell
School were found six cases, of which five were
double and affected the little fingers, the sixth
being in the fourth digit and unilateral; in two
the version was associated with slight hammer
flexion. It is occasionally seen in the index finger,
and the version is then towards the ulnar side.
The condition is rather unbecoming than inconvenient,
and cases are seldom brought to the surgeon
for relief. It is a result of irregularity of
development, the condyle growing a little more
rapidly on one side than on the other. The constancy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
of the radial direction of the version of the
little finger is probably explained by the fact that
any lateral pressure to which this digit is subjected
is from the ulnar side, while in the index finger
the pressure is more often from the radial side, and
hence an ulnar distortion is here the more usual.
The deflected joint may be straightened by the use
for a few weeks of a narrow metallic side splint,
jointed opposite the articulations. No operation
is required.</p>

<p>Exaggerated forms of distortion of the fingers
may occur in rheumatoid arthritis, gout, or chronic
rheumatism, and in various nervous affections,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
but these rarely call for surgical treatment.</p>

<h3 id="not_in_toc">CONTRACTIONS ARISING FROM INTERRUPTED EVOLUTION
OF THE FLEXORS OF THE FINGERS,
WITHOUT PARALYTIC OR SPASTIC COMPLICATIONS.</h3>

<p>This condition necessarily belongs to the pre-adult
stage of development. It is characterised
by persistent flexion of one or more digits, without
any articular abnormality, and unassociated with
spasm or paralysis, but the contraction is of a
different kind from that found in hammer finger
and hammer toe. The degree of flexion varies
with the position of the hand, and when the wrist<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
is strongly bent forwards the fingers may be
extended, perhaps completely, but extension of
the wrist is accompanied by a return of the contraction,
the degree of which increases progressively
as the wrist extension is carried nearer to its limit.
The power of grasp is little impaired. Any attempt
to overcome the flexion by violence is met by
powerful resistance, and great pain is induced. If
the patient be anæsthetised, the contraction
remains unaltered, but the resistance is felt to be
of a peculiar elastic character, and yields to a
slight extent during the application of passive
force. The defect leads to great interference with
the functions of the hand. The pain caused by
anything that tends to stretch the shortened
muscles induces a voluntary exaggeration of the
flexion, and after a time the control over the
extensors is apt to become impaired. The causes
are often obscure, but some examples have been
traced to traumatic injuries of the flexor side of
the forearm in infancy or childhood. In any case
the essential factor appears to be a trophic lesion
of local or central origin, which retards or arrests
the due growth of a muscle or a portion of a muscle
without causing its atrophy or paralysis. The
following cases will serve to illustrate the phenomena
so far as they have come under my own
observation:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Case 1.</span>—M. O., a domestic servant aged seventeen, was
admitted into St. Thomas’s Hospital in September 1889. On<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
examination the third, fourth, and fifth fingers of the right hand
were found to be flexed at the metacarpo-phalangeal and inter-phalangeal
joints—the two latter strongly, the former slightly.
When the wrist was fully extended the contraction became
more marked, and the distal phalanges of the ring and little
fingers touched the palm, but when the wrist was fully flexed
the fingers could be voluntarily brought into a state of complete
extension. The power of grasp was good, although
somewhat less than in the left arm; the bones were normal
in form and size; and the joints were quite free in their
movements when the flexors were relaxed by position. The
forearm muscles appeared to be of normal size. A small scar
was seen about two inches below the elbow, over the inner side
of the front of the arm, the result of a fall thirteen years
before. The patient was strong and healthy in appearance,
and showed no sign of neurotic disorder. She had never
suffered from rheumatism or any other severe illness, and the
family history appeared to be good. She stated that the contraction
began to appear in childhood, shortly after the injury
to the arm, but that it had been making more rapid progress
in the past eighteen months, during which she had been growing
very quickly. After a fruitless attempt to improve the
condition by passive motion and splint extension, neither of
which was well borne, it was determined to lengthen the
tendons by operation. On October 18, 1889, the patient was
chloroformed, and it was observed that the deepest anæsthesia
caused no relaxation of the contraction. A semicircular incision
was made over the inner side of the front of the forearm just
above the wrist, the convexity overlapping the tendon of the
flexor carpi ulnaris, the horns reaching to a line midway
between the radial and ulnar borders of the limb. The flap
of integument and fascia was reflected towards the radial side,
exposing the inner portion of the flexor sublimis. The tendon
of this muscle going to the ring finger was then isolated, transfixed
by a fine tenotomy knife, and split longitudinally for a
distance of two inches. At each end of the fissure so made
the tendon was divided in such a manner as to leave one-half
of the split portion attached to the proximal, the other to the
distal, end of the tendon. (<a href="#figure08">Fig. 8.</a>) The tendon, a very slender<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
one, to the little finger was similarly treated. The effect of
this measure upon the contraction was very slight. The portion
of the flexor profundus common to the middle, ring, and
little fingers was then drawn out and divided after the same
method, and the section was followed by immediate and complete
extension of the digits. When the fingers were fully
straightened, the ends of the divided tendons still overlapped
each other to the extent of about a third of an inch, and these
portions, in each tendon, were then carefully sewn together
by catgut sutures. The wound was then closed and dressed
antiseptically (without drainage), and the hand was placed
upon a plaster-of-Paris splint; the wrist and fingers being
moderately flexed, in order that no undue tension should
be thrown upon the united tendons. Healing took place by
first intention. At the end of a week the fingers were partially
extended, and four days later the extension was made
complete, the alteration of position on each occasion being
effected without difficulty, and at the expense of little pain.
In the middle of the fourth week after the operation a feeble
power of flexion had appeared. The patient was discharged
on November 13, twenty-six days after the operation. Two
months later the condition had much improved, and the
voluntary flexion, although still weak, was almost complete
as to range. All the tendons had evidently united firmly.
She was directed to wear an extension splint at night, and to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
practise active and passive movement at intervals in the day-time.
At the end of a further three months the patient, who
lived in the country, came again to London. She had been
growing taller in the interval, and said that the contraction
had been gradually reappearing. On inquiry it was found
that she had neglected her instructions as to extension and
motion. Some slight return of the flexion had appeared in
the ring and little fingers, and has since been steadily increasing,
till it is now almost as great as when she first attended.
She has made no adequate effort to oppose the retrogression,
but has almost entirely discontinued to use the affected hand.
She is still, however, able to move the fingers freely at all the
joints. She desires to undergo another operation; but has
been advised to obey the directions given to her after the
first, and to wait until her growth is quite complete before any
more active surgical treatment is undertaken.</p>

</figure>

<p>The pathology of this case is very obscure. The
contraction evidently depended upon a trophic
lesion, perhaps due to the injury in childhood,
involving the ulnar portion of the flexor profundus,
impeding the growth of the muscle, and so preventing
it from keeping pace with the normal
growth of the bone, but not causing paralysis.
The contraction of the flexor sublimis was evidently
secondary. The recurrence of the deformity may
be explained by the progressively increasing
length of the bones of the forearm, the muscle
remaining stationary; in other words, the original
cause of the condition—the incapacity of the profundus
for development—persisted, and led to a
return of the effect. Under these circumstances
it would obviously be advisable to delay a second
operation until the osseous system had reached its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
permanent proportions. The operation I believe
to be original; and so far as the restoration of
continuity of tendon is concerned, the result proved
a complete success. It might possibly be applied
with advantage in various conditions as a substitute
for tenotomy.</p>

<p>The operation was performed independently by
Professor Keen,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> about a twelvemonth after this
case, and has since been adapted to lengthening
and shortening of tendons by Drs. H. A. Wilson,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Colgan,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and Ochsner, in America.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Case 2.</span>—H. L., a youth aged seventeen, was admitted as
an out-patient at St. Thomas’s Hospital, in November 1890.
He complained of a contraction of the thumb and fingers of
the right hand of three years’ duration. The condition began
without apparent cause, and has increased progressively. He
was fairly well grown, but of somewhat delicate aspect. He
had an attack of rheumatic fever at the age of six, but had
since been in good health. The contraction was of the same
nature as that in Case 1, but less in degree, and involved all
the digits. The hand was well formed, and all the bones,
joints, and muscles were normal. The power of finger extension
was complete during flexion of the wrist. The forearm
flexors are rather small, but there is no distinct atrophy; the
movements at the wrist, elbow, and shoulder are perfect. He
said that the defect crippled him greatly for work, and that
forcible extension caused pain in the forearm. He was
instructed to carry out a system of massage, with active and
passive movements of the fingers and wrist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<h3 id="I_III">CONTRACTIONS DUE TO UNBALANCED ACTION OF
THE FLEXOR MUSCLES AFTER RUPTURE, DIVISION,
OR DESTRUCTION OF THE EXTENSOR
TENDON.</h3>

<p>These accidents are not uncommon in ordinary
hospital experience. The effect of such a solution
of continuity over the back of the hand is to leave
the first phalanx in a state of flexion, while the
second and third phalanges may be voluntarily
straightened without difficulty, especially if the
metacarpo-phalangeal joint be passively fixed in
the position of extension. The reason for this of
course is that the common extensor, by virtue
of its ligamenta dorsalia and its connection with
the aponeurotic fibres derived from the interossei,
acts with peculiar advantage upon the metacarpal
phalanx, although it has no direct attachment to
it, while its nominal “insertion” into the middle
and ungual phalanges is subservient to the interossei
and lumbricales, which are the true extensors
of these bones. On the other hand, if the lesion
fall just on the proximal side of the first inter-phalangeal
joint, the first phalanx may be susceptible
of almost complete voluntary extension; but
the second and third phalanges are bent by the
unopposed action of the superficial and deep flexors,
because the influence of the true extensors, the
lumbricales and interossei, has been cut off. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
like manner, a division of the tendon over the
middle phalanx leaves the terminal phalanx in
the position of flexion; and a similar result follows
the accident first described by Segond, in which
the extensor tendon is torn away with a portion
of the bone during forcible flexion of the ungual
phalanx.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>—If the injury be seen in the early
stage and there is no loss of substance at the point
of lesion, it may be treated satisfactorily by fixing
the finger, hand, and wrist in full extension, to
allow the passive approximation of the divided
extremities of the tendon; but should the case
not come under notice until a later period it will
be necessary to cut down and suture the tendon.
If there is loss of substance and the two ends of
the tendon cannot be brought together, the treatment
must vary with the position of the injury.
In some cases, where the metacarpal portion of the
tendon is involved, a good result may be obtained
by joining the distal end to the adjacent tendon
so as to bring it again within the control of the
muscle, but if the digital portion be the seat of
the lesion this is impracticable, and a remedy may
be found by lengthening the tendon, either by
splitting one or both ends and suturing the extremities
of the portions detached, or by transplanting
a portion of a tendon from a dog into the
gap. As a last resource the traction of the flexors
may be balanced by an elastic extension band<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
replacing the destroyed tendon, and attached by
one end to a little cap drawn over the finger, by
the other to the dorsal aspect of a wrist gauntlet.</p>

<h3 id="I_IV">CONTRACTIONS ARISING FROM NUTRITIVE CHANGES
IN THE MOTOR APPARATUS.</h3>

<p>There are at least three well-known forms of
pathological change in the motor apparatus of the
forearm (independent of the ordinary paralytic or
spastic conditions due to nerve lesions) that may
give rise to contractions of the fingers. These are—the
ischæmic paralysis of Volckmann, inflammatory
processes in the muscular sheaths, and gummatous
formations, or more rarely other tumour
growths in the muscles.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The affection described by Volckmann as
muscular paralysis of ischæmic origin is now seldom
met with. It is a result of prolonged immobilisation
of forearm fractures by any form of apparatus
that intercepts the free circulation of blood
through the muscles and nerves of the part.
When the splint is removed the hand is found
painful, dusky, and swollen, and the fingers are
bent like claws, any attempt to extend them
causing great pain. Volckmann believed that the
nerves in these cases have preserved their power
of conduction, but that the muscular fibres are
structurally injured and have lost their excitability.
The lesion, however, is seldom of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
permanent character, and the function may
generally be restored by systematic active and
passive movements, with massage, and if necessary
the use of a galvanic current. Its existence is a
reproach to surgery, since a careful observation of
the hand and fingers during the use of splints will
always give due warning of the danger.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Diffuse inflammation of the inter-muscular
planes and perimysial connective tissue may occur
as a result of poisoned wounds, and other injuries,
and may lead to a like deformity in the fingers.
In a case under my own charge it was caused by
a sting in the forearm by an adder. The injury
was followed by the usual pain and swelling,
accompanied by a painful contraction of the
fingers, which lasted for nearly three months, but
was ultimately relieved by the measures recommended
for the ischæmic paralysis. Wounds
implicating the flexors may occasionally lead to
permanent contraction—either as a result of actual
loss of substance, or in young subjects from interference
with the development of the muscle (as in
the case already mentioned). Under these circumstances
the operation of tendon lengthening
may be required if the endeavours to secure
gradual extension are unsuccessful. König
describes a case of flexion of the hand and fingers
in a newly-born child, caused by a tearing of the
flexors at the moment of disengagement of the
arm in the course of delivery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Gummatous formations in the forearm
flexors, causing painful contraction of the finger,
are comparatively rare. A very interesting case
of the kind is reported by Dr. A. G. Barrs in the
<i>Medical Chronicle</i> for May 1891. The muscle
affected was evidently the flexor profundus in its
ulnar portion; and the finger contraction which
bore a superficial resemblance to Dupuytren’s
disease, was complicated by other symptoms
indicating a concomitant affection of a portion of
the cord.</p>

<h3 id="I_V">CONTRACTION OF THE FINGERS DEPENDENT UPON
A TENDO-VAGINITIS OF THE BURSAL SHEATH
OF THE FLEXOR TENDONS.</h3>

<p>The following notes of an example of this
somewhat rare condition under my observation
may be of interest:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The patient, a girl, aged twenty, attended St. Thomas’s
Hospital for a swelling of the front of the right wrist, with
contraction of the fingers and complete loss of use of the hand.
She stated that the contraction appeared six days before
without apparent cause. On examination a large swelling
was found, extending upwards for about an inch and a half
above the anterior annular ligament, and distally along the
ulnar side of the palm as far as the root of the little finger.
The phalangeal joints of all the fingers were flexed, and any
attempt to straighten them caused considerable pain, while
the movements of the little finger were accompanied by a
peculiar coarse grating, that could be felt along the whole
length of the theca and in the palm, ceasing, however, at the
level of the carpus. The thumb was flexed and adducted,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
and the movements of flexion and extension were painful,
apparently because they led to disturbance of the enlarged
bursal sheath of the finger flexors. The affection was evidently
a tendo-vaginitis involving the carpal bursal sheath of the
finger flexors and the palmar extension which brings this
into communication with the digital bursal sheath of the
little finger. The crepitation indicated that the intra-vaginal
portion of the tendon was roughened by inflammatory deposits,
and it is possible that these irregularities may lay the foundation
for a subsequent trigger finger. The case was successfully
treated by immobilisation of all the joints of the wrists and
fingers in plaster of Paris, followed by passive movement as
soon as the acute stage was passed.</p>

</div>

<p>A tendo-vaginitis of the extensors over the
back of the hand may induce considerable functional
impairment of the fingers, with more or
less contraction at the metacarpo-phalangeal
joints. Such a condition has been described by
Vogt as an occasional result of gonorrhœa, and
Verneuil has met it as a manifestation of syphilis.
The majority of examples, however, occur without
any ascertainable constitutional cause.</p>

<h3 id="I_VI">CONTRACTIONS DEPENDENT UPON INFLAMMATORY
AND DEGENERATIVE CHANGES IN THE ARTICULAR
STRUCTURES.</h3>

<p>The deformities induced by gout, rheumatism,
and rheumatoid arthritis fall more directly within
the domain of the physician, while those due to
tuberculous or traumatic lesions are of more immediate
concern to the surgeon, but the characters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
which distinguish the various conditions from
each other are of interest for every practitioner.
The chief points bearing upon diagnosis are as
follows: In the <i>gouty form</i> the personal and
family history of the patient, the acute and
painful nature of the local inflammatory attacks,
the presence of urate of soda deposits in the part,
and the evidence of similar disease in other
portions of the body. In <i>chronic rheumatism</i>,
which is more often present in women and in the
poorer classes, the moderately painful attacks of
synovitis with crepitation, and evidence of wearing
away of cartilage. In <i>chronic rheumatoid arthritis</i>
the presence of bony outgrowths around the
margin of the articulation is the main element of
distinction from the latter condition. In <i>tuberculous
disease</i> the personal and family history, the
soft fusiform swelling, the tendency to breaking
down of the morbid tissue, and the more or less
complete destruction of the articular capsule in
the later stages. Contractions with ankylosis
may also occur in acute rheumatism and acute
rheumatoid arthritis, and in a peculiar neuropathic
condition simulating the latter. These will be
referred to in connection with the contractions of
the toes. In the traumatic forms the history and
marks of injury will usually be sufficient for
diagnosis; but it must, of course, be understood
that common injuries, by weakening the resistance
of the part, may localise the attack of a specific<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
disease, such as tuberculosis or gout, and hence
the onset of tubercular or gouty arthritis may
coincide with an ordinary traumatism. It is, as a
rule, only in the tuberculous and traumatic forms
that the surgeon is consulted. The treatment
must, of course, be based on general principles;
but it is necessary to recollect that an ankylosed
finger-joint nearly always renders the digit worse
than useless, especially if the articulation be fixed
in the position of extension.</p>

<p>It is only necessary to mention that contractions
without joint lesion may occur in the fingers
as a result of disease or injury of the bone.
Simple fracture in the neighbourhood of an articulation
may produce a deformity closely resembling
that of dislocation. Caries or necrosis may also
lead to a breach of continuity in the shaft of a
bone, and various distortions may follow the cure
of the disease.</p>

<h3 id="I_VII">CONTRACTIONS OF PARALYTIC AND SPASTIC
ORIGIN FOLLOWING LOCAL INJURY.</h3>

<p>A complete account of the various conditions
falling under this denomination would require an
entire course of lectures, and it is hence necessary
to confine our attention to those forms which
belong to the surgeon rather than to the physician.</p>

<p>Spastic conditions following local injury are very
rare. An example was brought before the Medical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
Society by Dr. Beevor<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> in April 1888, in which a
contusion of the right hand in a boy of fifteen
was followed five days later by permanent contraction
of the hand with total anæsthesia as far
as the shoulder and loss of the muscular sense, the
movements of the arm and forearm remaining
unimpaired. In the discussion a similar case was
referred to by Dr. Hadden.</p>

<p>All the nerves which govern the muscles acting
upon the fingers are liable to injury—the median
and ulnar more particularly by wounds, usually in
the wrist, and the musculo-spiral by pressure of a
crutch.</p>

<p>An injury involving solution of continuity of
the <i>Ulnar nerve</i> is a very grave accident, unless
it can be treated surgically without any long
delay. The symptoms are such as might be
inferred from a knowledge of the distribution of
the branches. It will be remembered that the
nerve supplies the flexor carpi ulnaris and ulnar
half of the flexor profundus digitorum in the forearm,
the whole of the muscles of the hand, except
the abductor, opponens, and outer head of the
flexor brevis pollicis, and the two inner lumbricales,
and it gives sensation to the skin over the inner
side of the wrist and hand, to the palmar and
dorsal surfaces of the little and ulnar half of the
ring finger, and sometimes also to the radial half
of the ring finger and ulnar half of the middle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
finger. The effects of the nerve lesion will, of
course, vary with the position of the injury. If
the trunk be divided just above the wrist, the
branches to the two forearm muscles and the
cutaneous branch to the back of the hand and
fingers will be spared; but the palmar cutaneous
filament will probably be implicated by the wound.
The paralysis of the interossei produces an inability
to flex the first phalanges and extend the second and
third, while the unbalanced action of the extensor,
and superficial and deep flexors, causes the position
of super-extension of the metacarpo-phalangeal
joint with flexion of the inter-phalangeal joints,
which constitutes the <i>main en griffe</i> of French
pathologists (<a href="#figure09">Fig. 9</a>). The clawing is chiefly
marked in the ring and little digits, especially the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
latter, but is lessened in the index and middle
fingers by the continued integrity of the first and
second lumbricales. There is, in addition, great
loss of power in flexion and adduction of the
thumb, and complete loss of sensation over the
front and distal part of the back of the little
finger and the corresponding portion of the ulnar
side of the ring finger. At a later stage nutritive
changes appear in the paralysed structures, and
the deformity becomes complicated by the atrophy
of the skin and subcutaneous fat, the hollowing of
the interosseous spaces and the wasting of the
thenar and hypothenar eminences. If the nerve
be injured at the elbow, the paralysis of the two
forearm muscles, and the loss of sensation over
the ulnar side of the back of the hand would add
to the symptoms, but would not sensibly affect the
deformity.</p>

  <p class="main">Deformity in case of wound of ulnar nerve above wrist.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The treatment is to seek for the divided ends of
the nerve, and to unite them if possible. Should
the interspace be too great to allow direct suture,
an attempt might be made to restore continuity
by cutting a long flap from the proximal extremity
of the nerve and bringing it down to the distal
end; or by the transplantation of a portion of
nerve from an amputated limb, or from one of the
lower animals. Where the wound lies immediately
above the wrist, it is well to remember
that the ulnar nerve and vessels are covered by a
fibrous band, which passes from the radial side of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon in this situation to
blend with the anterior annular ligament. It
should also be recollected that the deep branch of
the nerve, which is occasionally implicated in
penetrating wounds over the hypothenar eminence,
runs around the ulnar side of the tip of the
unciform process, and may there be exposed without
much difficulty.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> After operation the hand
should be placed in a position of adduction and
flexion, and the wound dressed antiseptically.
Should this measure fail, the apparatus devised
by Duchenne may be applied to replace the action
of the paralysed muscles.</p>

<p><i>Musculo-spiral paralysis</i> may be induced by
ordinary wounds or contusions, by fractures of the
humerus, or by long-continued compression of the
nerve against the bone, either by the handle of a
crutch, or while the patient is sleeping with his
head resting upon an arm which is supported
by the back of a chair. The consequences are
paralysis of the elbow extensors, the supinator
longus, the supinator brevis, and the whole of the
extensors of the wrist, thumb, and fingers; and
loss of sensation over the cutaneous areas supplied
by the nerve in the arm, forearm, and hand.
For the patient the most striking symptoms are
the flexion of the wrist and fingers, the loss of
power to abduct the thumb, and especially the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
enfeeblement of grasp due to the inability to fix
the wrist during the action of the finger flexors.
If the wrist be held firmly by the other hand, or
by another person, in the position of extension, the
power of grip becomes restored. A similar condition
is present in lead poisoning; but here the
loss of power is confined to the extensor muscles,
and the supinator longus remains unaffected. The
possibility of a crutch paralysis should lead the
surgeon to warn every patient who is compelled
to use the implement, in order that the paralysis
may be prevented, or, should it occur, that it may
be perceived and arrested in its earliest stages.
When the condition has become established, an
attempt should be made to restore function by
massage and electricity, and if these fail, the
nerve should be exposed at the seat of injury,
and its continuity restored by the excision of the
atrophic portion and union of the two free extremities.</p>

<p>In paralysis of the <i>Median nerve</i> by a wound
above the wrist, the most distressing symptoms
are referable to the trophic lesions in the integuments
of the thumb, index, middle, and ring
fingers (radial side) on their palmar surface and
the distal half of their dorsal aspect. There is,
in addition, a partial loss of power of flexion and
abduction of the thumb, with wasting of the
thenar eminence and some interference with the
delicacy of the movements of the index and middle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
fingers, owing to the paralysis of the first and
second lumbricales. If the nerve be divided above
the elbow, the pronators and all the flexors of the
wrist, thumb, and fingers, except those supplied
by the ulnar nerve (flexor carpi ulnaris, and ulnar
half of the flexor digitorum profundus), are paralysed,
and consequently the hand is, for all practical
purposes, quite useless. The rules for treatment are
similar in principle to those laid down for injuries
of the musculo-spiral and ulnar nerves.</p>

<p><i>Spastic Paralyses</i>, in connection with central
disease, need not be discussed; but the surgeon is
sometimes consulted for conditions of persistent
spasm which apparently depend upon excessive
use of certain muscles. Erichsen refers to, and
figures, a case of flexion with pronation attributed
to cutting with heavy shears. He notes that
when the wrist was extended the fingers became
flexed, and when the wrist was extended the
fingers became bent in. It is not stated whether
the permanency of the contraction was tested by
the use of an anæsthetic, but the patient, as well
as another in whom the extensors were affected in
like manner, became cured by means of friction
and galvanism, with the use of a straight splint.
A case of spastic contraction of the right little
finger of thirty-five years’ duration was recently
in the Mile End Infirmary. The flexion of the
finger is associated with slight adduction of the
hand, but the parts can be straightened completely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
by passive force. The condition is attributed
to a wound near the elbow. There is no
lesion of sensation.</p>

<p>The group of affections known as <i>Writer’s
cramp</i> usually fall within the province of the
physician, and will only be briefly referred to.
They are of uncertain pathology, vary considerably
in their manifestations, and, although most
common in persons much engaged in writing, are
by no means confined to these. The symptoms
may assume three different types—spastic, paralytic,
and tremulous—affecting the muscles of the
hands and forearm, and these may be combined in
various ways. The prognosis is unfavourable;
but the treatment found most hopeful is to relieve
the affected muscles from the strain to which they
have been accustomed, and strengthen them by
massage and galvanism. Interference by surgical
operation has been unsuccessful, except in one
case, in which Stromeyer divided the flexor longus
pollicis tendon.</p>

<h3 id="I_VIII">CONGENITAL AND INFANTILE CONTRACTIONS.</h3>

<p>These are usually of paralytic origin, but include
a proportion of cases of true hammer finger. The
common form is that already described by Mr.
William Adams (Medical Society, December 1890),
in which the inter-phalangeal joints of one or more
fingers (most frequently the fifth) are flexed, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
the integument on the palmar aspect forms a
longitudinal fold, which becomes tense when an
attempt is made to straighten the digit; the
metacarpo-phalangeal joint is super-extended. At
first the finger may be fully extended by passive
force, but after a few years the position of flexion
at the first inter-phalangeal joint is rendered
permanent by imperfect development of the
ligamentous fascial and even cutaneous structures
in front of the articulation, while the terminal
phalanx usually remains more or less helpless.
The condition is probably dependent upon an
infantile paralysis of the flexors of the affected
digit. The use of friction, passive movement, and
electricity, may be of value in the early stages.</p>

<h3 id="I_IX">TRIGGER FINGER.</h3>

<p>The description of this curious affection has been
left until the last because its true nature is still
an unsolved problem, and it is hence difficult to
place it in any of the groups already described. It
is indeed rather a pathological curiosity than an
important item in surgical disease, and many
surgeons of long experience have never met with
a single example. Of the mechanism of its causation
we know almost nothing, of its ultimate
tendencies we know little more, and its morbid
anatomy is almost entirely speculative. Nevertheless,
it has a literature extending over forty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
years, and comprising nearly a hundred separate
contributions, the last of which, a model in its
way, is a monograph of 250 closely printed large
octavo pages, the work of Dr. Carlier.</p>

<p>Trigger finger, the <i>doigt à ressort</i> of French
authors, may be defined as a peculiar defect in the
motions of the digit, consisting, first, of an impediment
which obstructs the movement of flexion or
of extension, or of both, followed, if the motive
force be continued, by a sudden cessation of the
resistance, and a brusque, spring-like action that
often bears a remarkable resemblance to that
which accompanies the opening and closure of the
blade of a penknife. The first observation was
that of Notta in 1850. A finger attacked by this
affection generally lies when at rest in a position
of flexion, and by a voluntary effort or by passive
force may be straightened, with the peculiar result
described in the definition, the resistance to extension
suddenly yielding with a trigger- or spring-like
action; and the same phenomenon is usually
but not necessarily repeated when the digit is again
bent. In exceptional cases a reverse condition
obtains: the passive finger is kept in a state of
extension, and it is during flexion that the trigger
phenomenon is elicited. The movement may be
merely inconvenient, or it may be more or less
painful. The sign may be constant, accompanying
every movement, or it may be intermittent, disappearing
and recurring without any obvious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
reason. It is usually confined to a single finger,
but it may be multiple. The digits most frequently
involved are the middle finger, the ring finger,
and the thumb, while the index and little fingers
are relatively free, and the right side is more often
affected than the left. It is rather more common
in women than in men (in the proportion of three
to two); and much more frequent in adults than
in children, but may appear at all ages. The
etiology is ill understood. In many cases an important
influence, direct or remote, has been
assigned to rheumatism; in others the condition
has been attributed to injuries of various kinds;
in others to occupations necessitating over-use of
the digital articulations (as in sempstresses); but
no cause has yet been recognised which can account
for any large proportion of the examples.</p>

<p><i>Pathology.</i>—The explanations of the peculiar
movement which characterises the disease are for
the most part of a purely theoretical character,
for, as might be anticipated, the opportunities for
direct examination of the structures have been
extremely rare. It speaks highly indeed for the
ingenuity of our investigators that so many
plausible hypotheses have been constructed upon
so small a basis of observed fact. The views now
open for consideration are as follow: (1) The
development of a fringe or other growth in the
synovial sheath of the flexor tendons. Such a
tumour lying in the synovial cul-de-sac, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
projects beyond the proximal end of the tendon
sheath when the fingers are flexed, would be
drawn within the theca during extension of the
digit, and might in this way oppose a resistance
to the movement which would be overcome as
soon as the body had passed the constricted
entrance of the theca. (2) A nodose condition
of the tendon due to the development of a
growth within the tendon or upon its synovial
investment. Such a nodosity is said to have been
unmistakably palpable in many cases; but in two
examples examined by Carlier, where the tactile
impression of a node was remarkably strong, the
tendons were found perfectly healthy at the point
of examination. On the other hand, Leisering of
Hamburg actually exposed a nodosity in the
profundus tendon at the level of the point at
which it entered the canal of the flexor sublimis,
excised it, and cured the disease. In another case
a fringe-like tumour was discovered springing
from the synovial covering of the flexor sublimis.
The nodosity accepted as a fact, the “spring”
phenomenon accompanying must be explained by
the varying resistance of different parts of the
theca, the impediment occurring at either of the
firm, resistant portions of the canal which lie at
the proximal opening of the sheath and opposite
the shafts of the first and second phalanges, and
the sudden release occurring at the weaker points,
just above the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
front of the first inter-phalangeal articulation. In
the case of the thumb, however, the fibrous sheath
is much thinner than in the fingers, and the
variations of strength in its different parts are
comparatively slight after the inter-sesamoid portion
of the canal is passed. An obstruction offered
to a nodule in the flexor profundus by the channel
in the flexor sublimis has been proposed as a
cause; but although this might be accepted for the
fingers, it would not apply to the thumb, which
has but one tendon within its theca. (3) An
alteration in the shape of the articular surface,
such as was first pointed out by König in hammer
toe. In these cases the movement of the distal
bone is intercepted by the presence of a ridge
extending transversely across the head of the
proximal bone, and when by voluntary or passive
force the ligaments are made to yield sufficiently
to allow the obstacle to be surmounted, the movement
is terminated by a sudden spring-like action
of the extensors or flexors, as the case may be.
This condition undoubtedly exists in certain cases
of hammer toe and hammer finger; but it must
be recollected that these two affections are
developmental, and always begin during the period
of active growth; while the great majority of
examples of trigger finger appear in adult life,
after the osseous and ligamentous elements of the
articulation have assumed their permanent form.
Corresponding changes of form, however, might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
occur in rheumatoid arthritis. (4) The development
on the side of the head of the proximal bone
of an osseous excrescence, so placed that the
narrow (proximal) attachment of the lateral ligament
must pass over it during the movements of
flexion and extension. The possibility of this
condition, suggested on theoretical grounds by
Poirier, cannot be denied; it is, in fact, normal
in the tibio-tarsal joint of the ostrich; but its
existence in the human subject has yet to be
demonstrated. It might well appear in connection
with rheumatoid arthritis, but indications of this
disease are found in only a small proportion of
cases of trigger finger. (5) Spastic irregularities
of muscular action. According to this view,
advanced by Carlier, the muscle at fault is nearly
always the flexor sublimis. It must be recollected
that the flexion of the first phalanx is effected
mainly by the interossei and lumbricalis, that of
the second principally by the flexor sublimis, and
that of the third entirely by the flexor profundus;
the extension of the first phalanx is due to the
common extensor aided by the special accessory
extensors in the case of the index and little
fingers; the corresponding movement of the second
and third phalanges is accomplished by the interossei
and lumbricales. In the thumb the metacarpo-phalangeal
joint is acted upon by the long
and short flexors in the one direction, and by the
extensores primi et secundi internodii in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
other, while the distal phalanx is flexed by the
long flexor and extended principally by the
abductor and flexor brevis, which send expansions
to the long flexor tendon. If, then, we assume
the existence of a reflex spasm of the flexor of a
joint the resistance must be overcome by vigorous
action of the extensors, or by passive force; and
if under these circumstances the spasm yield suddenly
the spring phenomenon might be closely
simulated. The theory is ingenious, but it involves
certain difficulties in its application to trigger
finger in general: first, that the “spring” ought
to be confined to the movement of extension,
unless we assume—and this perhaps is too much
to ask—that a similar spasm may affect the
extensor also, and be overcome in an analogous
way; secondly, that the spring movement should
be greatly altered when the tendon of the sublimis
is relaxed by flexion of the wrist and metacarpo-phalangeal
joint, a modification that has
not yet been recorded; thirdly, that it should
disappear during complete muscular relaxation
under chloroform, and in some cases at least this
has not happened.</p>

<p>For the present we must confess our inability
to decide the question. In the majority of cases
the tendon nodule hypothesis would explain the
phenomenon; and the articular theory might be
tenable in adolescent cases or where there is
rheumatoid arthritis; but more direct evidence is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
required and closer observation should be directed
to the effect of relaxation of groups of muscle by
position, and of the muscular system generally by
anæsthetics.</p>

<p>The treatment must to some extent share in
the uncertainty that attaches to the pathology.
The safest and most hopeful measures appear to
be a persevering use of passive movement, combined
with massage. Surgical operation has been successful
in two or three cases, but in others it has
missed its mark and has probably left the patient
in worse condition than before.</p>

modification to the latter.</p>

<h3 id="II_I">CONTRACTIONS DEPENDENT UPON PATHOLOGICAL
LESIONS IN THE CUTANEOUS AND FASCIAL
STRUCTURES.</h3>

<p>Lesions of the sole corresponding to Dupuytren’s
disease in the hand are extremely rare, on account
of the protection afforded by the shoe and the
thickness of the plantar pad, and although cases
have been mentioned by Mr. Adams and other
surgeons, I believe none has yet been shown or
discussed at any medical society. The following
example deserves record:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The patient, a gardener, aged fifty-seven, was admitted to
St. Thomas’s Hospital in May last with contraction of both
hands. He stated that he first noticed a slight contraction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
beginning in the ring finger of the left hand twelve years ago;
in the course of a year or two the disease extended to the little
finger, and afterwards to the middle finger. Four years since
a similar affection appeared in the right hand, and shortly
before admission he observed a superficial nodule on the sole
of each foot. He had never suffered from gout or rheumatism,
and had always enjoyed good health; the family history was
negative. On examination the third, fourth, and fifth fingers
were found contracted in both hands; the fourth and fifth
fingers of the left hand being strongly bent at the first and
second joints, and brought into contact with the palm, while
on the right side the lesions were similar in character but
less advanced. In each sole a flat subcutaneous nodule
could be felt adherent to the plantar fascia and slightly
to the integument over the head of the second metatarsal
bone, but there was no puckering of the skin, and the
position of the toes was quite unaffected. The contracted
cords in both hands were divided by multiple subcutaneous
incisions, and the fingers were extended by plaster-of-Paris
splints. The nodule upon the right sole was excised, and
found to consist of white fibrous tissue, longitudinally striated,
and adherent to the fascia, but could be detached from it
without difficulty. Under the microscope the appearances
presented were identical with those in the early stage of
Dupuytren’s contraction, and there is no doubt that the
foot nodule was pathologically the same as the contracted
tissue in the hands. The operations upon the hands and feet
were successful.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="II_II">CONTRACTIONS DUE TO DEVELOPMENTAL IRREGULARITIES
IN THE ARTICULAR STRUCTURES.</h3>

<p>This group includes the conditions known as
hammer toe, hallux flexus, and some of the lateral
versions of the toes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<h3 id="II_III">HAMMER TOE.</h3>

<p>This complaint may be described as a permanent
flexion from the straight line at either or both of
the inter-phalangeal joints, without paralysis of
muscles, unattended with any primary degenerative
or inflammatory disease of the articular structures,
and essentially confined in origin to the
period of active growth. Some precision of definition
is necessary to exclude similar deformities
of wholly different pathological nature.</p>

<p>Hammer toe was known long before it became
the subject of scientific observation. According
to Dr. Cohen,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the first printed description was
that by a French surgeon named Laforest, in a
volume published in 1782, and entitled “L’Art de
Soigner les Pieds”; but Laforest was the successor
of one Rousselot, who thirteen years earlier wrote
a book to which he gave the formidable name of
“La Toilette les Pieds, ou Traité de la Guérison
des Cors, Verrues, et autres Affections de la Peau,
et Dissertation abrégé sur le Traitement et la
Guérison des Cancers.” In this essay a flexion of
the toes attributed to the use of short shoes is
alluded to with sufficient clearness to make it
probable that Laforest had succeeded to the ideas
as well as to the practice of his predecessor. The
first account, however, with any pretensions to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
science, was that given by Boyer in 1822.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Since
that time the subject has been discussed repeatedly
in France, and within the last few years has been
brought forward twice in England, at the Clinical
Society in 1887, and at the Medical Society in
1889.</p>

<p>The deformity is found in both sexes, but
appears to be somewhat more frequent in the male
(three to two). The influence of <i>age</i> is very
strongly marked. The condition invariably begins
within the developmental period, and may show
itself at any time between birth and adult life,
but most frequently attracts the notice of the
patient for the first time during the third quinquennial
period. Amongst a number of incipient
cases seen at Hanwell not more than one-tenth
were under twelve years of age, the little toe
being usually the seat of the earlier manifestations.
It is said to be occasionally congenital. So far as
my own observations go, neither class, occupation,
nor constitutional condition, appears to have any
share in its production.</p>

<p>It has long been a popular as well as a medical
opinion that the deformity is handed down by inheritance.
Even Laforest, who contests the belief,
says, “Je m’entends souvent dire que l’on est né
avec un doigt ainsi; que c’est un doigt de famille.”
Boyer asserted that it was frequently inherited,
and Blum and others have adduced examples in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
support of this view. In a paper read before the
Clinical Society in 1887, I referred to a history in
four cases out of twenty-two which had the same
bearing; and other striking examples have since
been brought forward by Mr. Adams. In fact,
some evidence of the influence of the hereditary
principle may be traced in at least a fourth of the
examples that come under notice, and is particularly
frequent and clear amongst patients of the
educated classes.</p>

<p>The subjoined pedigree of a family in which
the affection has arisen, illustrates the descent
through four generations. It was noted that the
children attacked were those who presented most
resemblance in feature and temperament to the
grandfather. The deformity usually appeared
about the age of four, and was confined to the
second toe. “Double-jointed” thumbs were also
an inheritance in the family. In another example
the condition developed in five children out of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
eleven. Here too there was a history of “double-jointedness”
in the fingers and thumb, extending
through three generations; and an aunt on the
male side was also the subject of hammer finger.
This association of hammer toe with other developmental
irregularities is significant enough to
deserve attention. In addition to the instances
mentioned, there are amongst the seventy-three
surgical cases on my list three accompanied by
hallux flexus, and one with retraction of both little
toes; and there is little doubt that coincidences
of a like kind would more frequently be found
were it always possible to ascertain the facts by
inquiry.</p>

<p><i>Seat of attack.</i>—In surgical cases the toe most
commonly affected is the second. In my list of 73
patients who had applied for treatment, this digit
was affected in all but four, while the third was
attacked in five, the fourth in one, and the fifth in
three cases. In one instance the affection of the
third toe was symmetrical, each afforded only a
single example; but if all cases of contraction of
the joint for 30° or more be counted without reference
to symptoms, the condition is far more
frequent in the little toe than in the others. Thus
in an examination of a series of 800 children under
sixteen years of age the little toe was found to be
involved in forty-one cases, nearly all of which
were double, while the second toe was affected in
six only, and the third toe in five. It may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
noted also that the projection of the extremity of
the second toe beyond that of the first—a condition
regarded as a type by the ancient sculptors—was
present in only three instances. This is confirmed
by Professor Flower, who failed to find a single
instance in many hundreds of children.</p>

<p>The deformity is bilateral and symmetrical in
nearly a third of the cases, in the rest having a
slight preference for the right side, in the proportion
of five to four. It is usually localised in the
first inter-phalangeal articulation, but occasionally
implicates both inter-phalangeal joints, or the
distal joint only.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>—The stages of the deformity in a
typical case may be described as follows: In the
<i>first</i> period, which is rarely seen by the surgeon,
the toe is slightly extended at the metatarso-phalangeal
articulation, and flexed at the proximal
inter-phalangeal joint. By passive movement the
flexed joint may often, but not always, be extended;
but the range of motion, even in the early stage,
is found to be less than that of the neighbouring
or opposite toe. The distal joint is usually unaffected,
and may be held straight or slightly
flexed, but occasionally it undergoes contraction,
either alone or in association with the proximal
articulation. There is no evidence at this or any
subsequent time of inflammation in or around the
joint structures, except in association with corns or
bursæ. How long this period may last it is difficult<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
to say, as it may altogether escape the notice of
the patient. In the <i>second</i> stage the flexion of
the inter-phalangeal joint becomes more pronounced,
and the secondary extension at the
metatarso-phalangeal joint increases <i>pari passu</i>.
At this period the affected articulation is fixed for
all movement of extension, but the power of flexion
within the limits left to it remains unimpaired; in
other words, the angle may be diminished, but not
widened, and the toe, although contracted, is
neither ankylosed nor paralysed. In exceptional
instances the flexion may be overcome by strong
passive force, and a distinct trigger-like action
established, the middle phalanx becoming extended
and flexed again with a movement very comparable
to that which takes place during the opening and
shutting of the blade of a pocket-knife. As
secondary results of the contraction of the
proximal inter-phalangeal joint the patient is
subject to certain inconveniences which may give
rise to much suffering, and are usually the
immediate cause of his appeal to the surgeon.
The chief of these are a bursal formation, which is
very liable to inflammation, over the angle of
flexion, and two associated callosities, one above
the head of the retracted phalanx, the other
beneath the head of the metatarsal bone, both
consequent upon the pressure exercised by the
boot. (See <a href="#figure10">Fig. 10.</a>) A third callosity may develop
over the tip of the toe, and the soft parts over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
terminal joint may become somewhat swollen, so
that the digit presents a clubbed appearance. The
degree of interference with functions and comfort
varies greatly in different cases, partly in relation
to the degree of the contraction and partly to the
sensibility of the patient. In some persons a
hammer toe of a marked kind will cause so little
trouble that no medical advice is sought—this is
especially the case when the contraction is limited
to the little toe; in others the suffering is so great
that the patient begs the surgeon to remove the
offending member with the knife, and remains
absolutely crippled until an operation is practised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
for his relief. When the deformity affects more
than a single digit, an interval varying from a
few months to five or six years may elapse before
the second attack appears. As a rule, it is the
corresponding toe on the opposite foot that suffers,
but occasionally a neighbour is selected; or even
the distal joint of the same or another toe.</p>

<p><i>Morbid anatomy and pathology.</i>—The earlier
opinions upon the pathology of hammer toe were
very conflicting. Gosselin, who dissected a specimen,
was unable to find any lesion. Fano, in
1855, mentions as the chief defect a cartilaginous
nucleus in the extensor tendon. Blum described
a luxation of the first phalangeal joint, with a
thickening of the whole capsule, and maintained
that the contraction of the toe was due to a peri-arthritis
set up by the inflammation resulting from
corns—a curious example of “hysteron proteron.”
Blandin attributed the affection to a shortening
of the plantar fascia; Boyer to a retraction of the
extensor tendons; Roche and Sanson to a contraction
of the flexor tendons, and other surgeons
to a paralysis of the interossei, but no attempt
was made to separate true hammer toe from the
arthritic and traumatic deformities which simulate
it. It is now beyond doubt that the essential seat of
the contraction is in the joint itself. The specimen
represented in <a href="#figure10"><span class="allsmcap">B</span>,
<span class="allsmcap">C</span>, Fig. 10</a>, is one prepared by
myself in 1882 from a toe which had been amputated
by a colleague. It showed that the deformity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
was not affected by section of the tendons, but
that it yielded immediately upon division of the
plantar fibres of the lateral ligaments where they
blended with the glenoid plate. This observation,
which has been confirmed by a dissection of Mr.
Walsham’s, was not published until 1887, and it
was by Mr. Shattock, who, working independently,
had found the same lesion, that the condition was
first made known at the Clinical Society in the
same year. The preparation illustrating his paper
is now in the museum of St. Thomas’s Hospital,
as well as a second dissection demonstrating the
absence of disease in the interossei. The results
of these and later investigations may now be
stated.</p>

<p>(1) There are no essential alterations of muscle
or tendon except those secondary to the contraction
of the joint—namely, an undue tension and prominence
of the extensor tendon over the metatarso-phalangeal
articulation, and an adaptive deficiency
of length in the flexors, which are prevented by
the permanently bent state of the articulation
from keeping pace in growth with the osseous
structures. (2) The skin and fasciæ in like manner
are unaffected or only undergo a secondary shortening
on the flexor side in severe and long-standing
cases. (3) The articular surfaces generally
show no change beyond atrophy of that portion of
the cartilage of the head of the proximal bone,
which is permanently excluded from contact with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
the distal bone in consequence of the imperfect
range of extension of the joint. In some cases,
however, a distinct transverse groove is present on
the head of the proximal phalanx at the point
where it comes in contact with the dorsal border
of the base of the distal bone during the attempt
at extension, and behind this groove the bone may
be heaped up into a little ridge. It is the existence
of this irregularity that explains the trigger
phenomenon previously alluded to. (4) The ligaments
present no structural change, but an important
quantitative defect is always found in the
plantar fibres of the lateral ligaments, which are
so short that they check prematurely the movement
of extension of the joint.</p>

<p>The real origin of the articular defect has been
the source of much argument. At all times,
whatever may have been the opinion as to the
exact morbid anatomy of the condition, there has
been a strong disposition to blame the shoemaker,
or rather the fashion that dictated the arbitrary
form the shoe was to assume, as the prime cause
of the disease. There is, of course, no question
that the mistaken ideal of elegance which finds
expression in the demand for tight and pointed
boots has been the cause of much misery and
deformity, and it appears only natural to assume
that the artificial crowding together of the toes
might force one of the members to assume a position
of retraction, in order to make room for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
rest, and the digit so drawn up might after a time
become permanently fixed in its abnormal attitude.
This view is well expressed by Mr. Ellis,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> but the
study of a number of cases of hammer toe furnishes
strong reason for doubting this fatally plausible
hypothesis. The deformity may be seen in early
infancy, before any rigid foot covering has been
adopted; and a precisely analogous condition is
known to exist in the fingers, which are not subjected
to any artificial restraints. Moreover, in
the great majority of the feet affected with hammer
toe there is a complete freedom from the deformities
which are known to result from overcrowding of
the digits, and there is seldom anything in the
history of the cases to indicate the past use of
improper boots.</p>

<p>It has been said that hammer toe is unknown
in countries where boots are not worn; but the
subject has yet to be studied in those parts of the
world on a scale that sanctions generalisation.
Moreover, as hammer toe is painful only in consequence
of the friction and pressure induced by
the foot-covering, its existence would be unlikely
to attract much attention in a bootless race.
During my own residence of six years in Japan I
never met with an example, and my friend
Surgeon-General Takaki writes to me that his
observations, covering a period of fifteen years, are
equally negative; but it must be noted that it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
the rising and boot-wearing generation that has
been especially brought under our notice, and the
conclusions to be drawn from our experience tend
as much to contradict the view that boots are an
immediate cause of hammer toe, as to support the
belief that the Japanese are exempt from the
defect. There is little doubt, however, that the
use of shoes is to some extent, and in a remote
sense, a predisponent to this and to other
analogous deformities, for it is certain that a rigid
leather foot-covering, even when shaped according
to the most scientific principles, must necessarily
impede the free action of the toes, and so interfere
with the processes of nutrition and development;
but I am equally confident that few, if any, of the
examples of hammer toe that have come within
my own experience could be traced to any special
defect in the form of the shoe. Out of the whole
number only six confessed to having worn tight
boots. In the rest, neither history nor inspection
indicated any fault of the kind, and the feet in
the great majority were perfectly well formed in
all other respects, and bore no marks of injurious
compression. In a case of inherited hammer toe in
which the proximal joint of the second digit of the
right foot was straightened by operation, the
boots worn before and after the operation were
made upon sound anatomical principles; but
nevertheless the patient came two years later
with a contraction of the distal joint of the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
toe and of the middle toe of the opposite foot, and
a lateral distortion of the fourth toe.</p>

<p>The pathological explanation I believe to be
that advanced to account for the occurrence of
hammer finder. The examination of a large number
of healthy feet will reveal physiological variations
in the condition of the inter-phalangeal joints
exactly comparable with those noted in the hands.
The second phalanx may in some persons be
super-extended 30° beyond the axial line of the
proximal bone, while in other instances the movement
is arrested by tension of the plantar fibres
of the lateral ligaments before this line has been
attained;<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and in the distal joint even greater
variation may be found. There is, in fact, a
physiological tendency to hammer toe in large
numbers of people who never actually suffer any
inconvenience from it, and it is in the exaggeration
of this physiological irregularity that we have to
seek the pathology of the surgical hammer toe.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
The tendency ceases at adult life, because the
ligamentous and bony structures of the articulation
have then assumed their permanent condition,
and any later deformity simulating it can only
occur as a result of a totally different set of
conditions.</p>

<p>Hammer toe, then, like hammer finger, must be
regarded as the result of inadequate longitudinal
evolution of the ligaments which limit the movement
of extension at the inter-phalangeal joints,
and the symptoms induced by the deformity
are mainly dependent upon the formation of
callosities and bursæ by contact with the opposed
hard surfaces of the foot covering. This irregularity
of development may be either inherited or accidental.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>—It is probably not within our power
to prevent the occurrence of hammer toe, even by
the greatest care in the selection of boots. For
its relief when developed many plans have been
adopted, the chief of which are as follow:</p>

<p>1. Extension by splints of various kinds in the
early stages, while the contraction may be overcome
by passive force. The condition is rarely seen by
the surgeon in this period, but should it fall under
observation the persevering use of passive extension
is preferable. When the deformity is well marked,
splints are painful and useless.</p>

<p>2. Tenotomy of the extensor tendon (Boyer).
This measure, which was doubtless suggested by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
the visible tension of the tendon in many cases, is
more likely to aggravate than to relieve the
symptoms.</p>

<p>3. Tenotomy of the flexor tendons. This to be
successful must involve also the section of the
glenoid and lateral ligaments. Such an operation
has been practised both by the subcutaneous and
by the open methods, but it involves the risk of
division of the plantar digital nerves, and the
necessity for a prolonged after-treatment to
prevent recurrence. It has even been advised by
Petersen to treat the contraction by a transverse
incision, through integuments, tendons, and ligaments,
down to the articulation, but the promptitude
of the method is its sole recommendation.</p>

<p>4. Subcutaneous division of the lateral ligaments
has been performed with good results by Mr.
Adams, but it has the disadvantage of requiring a
long after-treatment.</p>

<p>5. Resection of the joint. This is unquestionably
the most eligible measure, and has been successfully
practised on different plans by various surgeons
during the last twelve years or more, both in
England and France. The articular extremities of
both bones may be removed or the head of the
proximal bone only, the distal bone being left
intact. In either case the toe is subsequently
fixed for a period of three or four weeks in an
extended position. The procedure I have found
most speedy and satisfactory is as follows: An<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
incision is made on the lateral aspect of the
affected articulation, following the axis of the
bones and exposing the lateral ligament, while
leaving intact the vascular and nervous trunks.
The ligament is then divided, by a touch of the
knife, and by a forcible lateral movement the head
of the proximal phalanx is made to protrude
through the wound, and is removed with a pair of
bone nippers. The toe is straightened, the wound
closed by sutures (without drainage), and dressed.
Antiseptic precautions must be strictly observed,
and the operation must not be performed until all
inflammatory signs have been removed from the
superjacent corn. The operation can be completed
within two or three minutes, and, what is a far
more important consideration, it involves the least
possible interference with the structures of the toe.
The wound heals by first intention, and after a
fortnight’s rest the patient is able to walk, the toe
being extended for a few weeks upon a dorsal
splint of flat steel, such as was used in making the
now obsolete appendages to the back of the
feminine skirt. The result is all that could be
desired, and the relief immediate and permanent.
The same operation is applicable for the distal
joint, but is less easy.</p>

<p>6. Amputation was, until within the last ten or
twelve years, the usual resource after the failure of
tenotomy of the extensor. It affords a curious
comment upon the surgery of the pre-antiseptic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
period that the chief reason given against this
operation by the early writers was its danger to
life. At the present time it can rarely be needed
unless, by any accident, the antisepsis of the
resection operation fails and acute inflammation
sets in. The objections to it are the mutilation,
and the tendency to lateral distortion of the
adjacent toes to fill the gap left by the lost
member.</p>

<h3 id="II_IV">HALLUX FLEXUS.</h3>

<p><i>Hallux flexus</i> appears to have been first recognised
as a separate affection only a few years
ago, in 1887, and it is to Mr. Davies-Colley that
we are indebted for the name and for the earliest
discussion of the characters and causation of the
disease. It is stated, however, by Blum that
Nélaton described a “cou de cygne” of the great
toe, and attributed it to the use of short boots. I
have been unable to discover the reference in the
works of this surgeon, but if the citation can be
verified, the credit of recognising the existence
and nature of the deformity will fall to him, for
there is no doubt that hallux flexus is pathologically
a “cou de cygne” or hammer toe. Since
Mr. Davies-Colley’s introduction of the subject
various contributions have been made, by Mr.
Howard Marsh, Mr. Reginald Lucy, Mr. Cotterell,
Mr. Ellis, and others, and I must draw especial
attention to a valuable analysis of thirteen cases<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
by my colleague, Mr. Makins, in the St. Thomas’s
Hospital Reports for 1888. The complaint is by
no means a rare one, for since 1887, when I began
to take notes of all the cases that were brought
under my observation in private and hospital
practice, I have accumulated a list of thirty
examples of what may be termed true “hallux
flexus,” besides a number of contractions presenting
a superficial resemblance to it, but resulting
from arthritic lesions. I propose, as in the case
of hammer toe, to separate these latter entirely
from the former, because the pathological, and
even the clinical, distinctions between the two
classes are perfectly well marked, and it hence
can only mislead to place them in the same
category.</p>

<p>Hallux flexus may be defined as a progressive
diminution of the normal range of extension at
the metatarso-phalangeal, or, more rarely, at
the inter-phalangeal joint of the great toe. It is
unassociated with any disease of the bones, cartilages,
or synovial membrane of the articulation,
and originates only during the period of active
growth. It is, in fact, a “hammer great toe,”
and it will be found strictly analogous to the
disease just described, occurring under the same
conditions and affecting the corresponding articulations.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
The name proposed by Mr. Davies-Colley<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
has been objected to on more grounds than
one. In the first place, there is perhaps a lack of
soundness in the pedigree of the word “hallux.”
It is a rather modern addition to anatomical
nomenclature, and its sanction in classical literature
is very dubious. In Plautus there is an
expression “hallex viri,” implying a little man, a
“thumbling,” and the words “hallex,” “allex,”
and “hallux” have been used by other writers
with a somewhat questionable signification for the
great toe. A purist might indeed be justified in
opposing the adoption of either “hallex” or
“hallux,” and especially the latter; but the convenience
attached to a distinctive name for the
great toe in place of that of “pollex,” which is
applied also to the thumb, is so great that we are
not tempted to be hypercritical on philological
grounds. A more serious objection has been
raised against the adjective “flexus,” because in
the majority of cases the toe is not actually in the
position of flexion; but the term “flexion” may
be applied in the sense of movement as well as in
that of position; and although the great toe in
hallux flexus may not reach the position of flexion,
it has passed through the motion of flexion before
it has attained the line of direction in which it is
found in the disease.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms.</i>—In a typical case of hallux flexus
the patient, usually a boy near the age of puberty,
suffers some little pain about the metatarso-phalangeal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
articulation of the great toe in walking,
at the moment when the weight of the body falls
chiefly upon this joint. Rest affords complete
relief, and the structures about the articulation
show no signs of inflammation. As time goes on
the pain increases and becomes associated with a
sense of rigidity of the toe, and the power of full
extension becomes lost. The diminution of the
range of movement is very gradual, and usually it
is not until the proximal phalanx can no longer be
extended beyond a line corresponding to the prolonged
axis of the metatarsal bone that the
condition is brought before the surgeon, but in
more extreme examples the toe becomes actually
bent below this axis, so that it forms with the
metatarsal bone an obtuse angle with plantar
opening. The foot is now seriously crippled.
Over-use in walking induces much suffering, and
any attempt at passive extension is extremely
painful, while flexion still remains unimpaired.
The head of the metatarsal bone thrown into
prominence by the unwonted position of the
proximal phalanx looks abnormally large. In
some cases a reflex hyperæmia of the tissues
surrounding the joint may be induced by forced
exercise; but there is rarely, if ever, any effusion
within the capsule. The patient finds walking
more and more difficult, and to avoid pressure
upon the contracted articulation limps on the
outer edge of the foot; but this gives little relief,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
and at last he is compelled to rest. In the more
severe cases the patient consults the surgeon; in
the slighter forms he puts up with the inconvenience,
and we may assume that he recovers
without professional assistance, for the condition
is very seldom found after the attainment of full
adult life.</p>

<p>An analysis of my series of thirty cases shows
that the deformity is much more frequent in boys
the number including only three girls. (In the
series of thirteen cases recorded by Mr. Makins
the proportion of males to females was eleven to
two). It was bilateral in one case only, right-sided
in nineteen cases, left in ten, and affected the metatarso-phalangeal
articulation in every instance,
except two in which the distal joint was involved.
(<a href="#figure11">Fig. 11.</a>) In only three cases did the flexion pass
the prolonged axis of the metatarsal bone, the
angle reached in the worst example being 150°;
in the rest the toe during full extension was either
in a line with the metatarsal bone, or formed with
the latter a very obtuse angle, 170° to 160°, with
the opening towards the dorsal aspect. The ages
at which the symptoms were first noticed ranged
from twelve to eighteen, in the greater number
lying between fourteen and sixteen. The associated
deformities were: excessive length of toe in two
cases, this amounting to a distinct giant growth
in one, hammer toe (second) in one, hallux valgus
(slight) in three, flat-foot in four, and slight varus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
in one. In the other cases the feet were perfectly
normal in shape. The duration of the disease
before the patient came under treatment varied
from three months to four years. Occupation
appeared to exercise little influence; the subjects
were mostly schoolboys, labourers, and errand
boys, but there was no reason to believe that
there had been any unusual strain upon the powers
of endurance, except in two instances. In two
cases the condition was attributed to the use of
short boots, but in the others no complaint was
made as to the foot covering, and that in wear at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
the time of attendance was as unobjectionable as
the materials and plan of the modern boot will
allow. Constitutionally, the patients were, for the
most part, a little below the average in physique;
one (a girl) was tuberculous, and one was a child
of rheumatic parents, but none had suffered from
rheumatism. The result of inquiries with respect
to inherited tendencies was less striking than in
the case of hammer toe. In one instance the
father had double hammer toe, in another a
brother had suffered from hallux flexus at the age
of sixteen, and became cured without medical
intervention in the course of three years; but in
the majority no satisfactory information on the
point could be obtained.</p>

  <p class="main">Hallux flexus of the distal joint.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><i>Progress.</i>—There can be little doubt that the
natural tendency of the complaint is to subside
under the mechanical influence of ordinary exercise,
and hence, although the deformity is fairly
common in youth, it is rarely found in fully
developed adults, except where the distal joint is
affected. In one case of this kind the contraction
began about puberty, and was still present at the
age of fifty-two, but the defect never interfered
materially with locomotion. It is possible that
some of the ordinary cases terminate, as suggested
by Mr. Davies-Colley, by conversion into hallux
valgus, but my inquiries have failed to confirm
this.</p>

<p><i>Pathology.</i>—The origin of the condition may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
explained in the same manner as that of hammer
finger and hammer toe. There is a physiological
variation in the range of movement permitted in
the articulations of the great toe similar to that
demonstrated in the fingers and lesser toes, and in
examining a number of healthy feet it will be found
that the position of extreme super-extension at the
metatarso-phalangeal joint may lie at any point
between 30° and 110° beyond the prolonged axis
of the metatarsal bone; but if the movement of
extension be checked at less than 30°, the symptoms
of hallux flexus supervene. The chief distinctive
feature in the anatomy of the joint lies in the
substitution of two sesamoid bones, with their
tendons and connecting tissue, for the glenoid
plate developed in all the other articulations,
and it is those structures that receive the distal
attachment of the plantar fibres of the lateral
ligaments. (<a href="#figure12">Figs. 12 and 13.</a>) The function of
the lateral ligaments, however, remains the same
as in the other toes, and the range of the movement
of extension is governed by the development
of their plantar fibres.</p>

  <p class="main">Hallux flexus of the distal joint.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The opportunities of examining the morbid
anatomy of the complaint are necessarily very
few. Mr. Davies-Colley’s specimen proves that
the structures restraining the movement of extension
correspond to those concerned in the production
of hammer toe, those fibres of the lateral
ligaments which blend with the osseo-tendinous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
structures replacing the glenoid plate; and the
cause of the deformity in both cases appears to be
an irregularity of nutrition by which the ligamentous
fibres undergo imperfect longitudinal
development, and consequently induce premature
arrest of the movement of extension. This
developmental defect is probably unconnected
with any special error in the form of the shoe.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
Like hammer toe, the deformity occurs at the
age most prone to nutritive disturbance; but
hallux flexus tends to undergo cure without the
help of the surgeon, because the weight of the
body serves as an extending force, which sooner
or later proves stronger than the resistance
opposed; while in hammer toe the lesser digit is
not essential to locomotion, and its retraction at
the metatarso-phalangeal joint frees the inter-phalangeal
joint from all necessity for action, and
favours the permanency of the vicious position.</p>

<p>Hallux flexus of the distal joint must be distinguished
from the paralytic hallux retractus
which simulates it (see <a href="#Page_127">p. 127</a>).</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>—Bearing in mind the fact that true
hallux flexus has a natural tendency to recovery,
it is obvious that the graver surgical operations
can seldom be called for. In the case of hammer
toe a resection of the articulation may be undertaken
without hesitation, because the deformity
is more likely to become aggravated than relieved
by lapse of time, and because the function of the
digit is not sensibly interfered with by obliteration
of the joint; but the destruction of the metatarso-phalangeal
joint of the great toe entails a permanent
alteration of gait. The treatment I have
adopted in the milder cases is to instruct the
patient to perform a regulated series of passive
movements of the toe by the use of his hands,
aiding the process by massage of the lower and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
inner side of the foot, and as the tenderness passes
away to practise walking on tiptoe until the
normal degree of extension is restored. In more
severe examples I have extended the joint forcibly
under an anæsthetic, afterwards fixing it in the
super-extended position in a plaster splint for
three weeks. The result of this plan has been so
satisfactory that I have found it unnecessary to
do more, but should it fail, we have the choice of
several plans: (1) Section of the lateral ligaments,
subcutaneously or by means of an open
wound. (2) Excision of the head of the metatarsal
bone, an operation necessarily involving
obliteration of the joint and a shifting of the
point of support to the distal joint, which is less
well fitted to discharge the office. It might, however,
be permissible in certain cases. (3) Excision
of the proximal half of the first phalanx. This has
been successfully effected by Mr. Davies-Colley.
(4) Osteotomy of the metatarsal bone above the
head, with excision of a dorsal wedge proportioned
to allow the toe to be placed in a position
of slight super-extension, the articulation
being preserved intact.</p>

<p>It is improbable that any of these more severe
measures will be required if the method of forcible
reposition be well carried out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<h3 id="II_V">HALLUX VALGUS.</h3>

<p>This, the most common of all digital deformities,
may be defined as an eversion of the great toe at
the metatarso-phalangeal joint, and in some
instances of the phalangeal joint also, with alterations,
adaptive or causative, in the bony and
ligamentous apparatus of the articulation. It is
often accompanied by deformities of the other
toes and by flat foot. In its milder forms it
must be regarded as a simple malposition caused
by the use of boots constructed on the principle
of median symmetry; and as this fault is more
common in the shoes made for women than in those
worn by men, the distortion is far more frequent in
the latter sex. In a large number of patients
examined by Dr. Robinson and myself in the
female wards of the Mile End Infirmary, over ten
per cent. were found to be affected in greater or
less degree; while in the male wards the proportion
did not exceed three per cent. It is a noteworthy
fact that the deformity is comparatively rare in
the period before puberty. I was able to find
only three examples, and these of a very slight
kind, among 800 children under the age of sixteen;
while incipient hammer toes and hammer fingers
were present in considerable numbers. This early
immunity is probably due to the fact that the
vanity which leads the adolescent to sacrifice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
comfort to a false elegance has not awakened in
the child. The more severe cases of hallux valgus
in which the toe is so far everted as to form an
angle of from 120° to 90° with the metatarsal
bone are comparatively rare, the total number
amongst 2600 persons amounting to no more than
thirty (twelve male and eighteen female). It is
with these that we are especially concerned, and
it is probable that they are closely related in
origin to hallux flexus.</p>

<p><i>Morbid anatomy.</i>—On examining a well-marked
hallux valgus it is seen that the facetted surface
of the head of the metatarsal bone has been
extended considerably over the external aspect,
the prominent inner side of the head lies beneath
the stretched joint capsule, the sesamoid bones are
displaced outwards from their normal grooves, the
internal lateral ligament is greatly elongated and
considerably thickened, the external ligament
undergoes an inversely proportionate shortening
and opposes the reposition of the displaced phalanx
(<a href="#figure14">Fig. 14</a>); and the cartilage over the portion of
the joint surface, removed from its normal contact
with the opposed bones, presents marked degenerative
changes. The integumentary structures over
the projecting head of the metatarsal bone are
affected in the same way as those over the angle
of flexion in hammer toe, as a consequence of friction
by contact with the shoe leather; callosities
and bursal formations, often of great size, are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
found, and inflammation of the abnormal bursa may
give rise to great suffering.</p>

<p>Although the great majority of cases of hallux
valgus are undoubtedly provoked by ill-shaped
boots, it is probable that some, and especially
those of a very aggravated type, are, like hallux
flexus and hammer toe, dependent essentially
upon causes not obviously connected with any
vice in the foot covering. It is at least certain
that some examples of extreme deformity are
confined to one foot, the opposite member being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
of normal shape—a fact that strongly negatives
the boot theory; and there are also bilateral cases
in which the form of the distortion and the history
given by the patients and friends make it equally
difficult to accept the common explanation. In
one instance recently under my notice the first,
second, and third toes of the left foot were carried
outwards over the fourth, producing a deformity
of a strongly marked kind, while the right foot
was perfectly well formed, and the patient, an
intelligent woman, insisted that “the toes went
wrong by themselves while she was growing up,”
and that her shoes had nothing to do with it. In
some cases the conditions may be traced to paralytic
or spastic affections, and if we accept the
developmental theory with respect to hammer toe
and hallux flexus, we may assume that hallux
valgus occasionally arises in the same way.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>—Hallux valgus, like hammer toe, is
often rather a question of æsthetics than of pain
or inconvenience, and the patients are only moved
to see the surgeon by a natural desire to get rid of
a deformity; but in many cases the inflammatory
complications occuring in connection with the
associated “bunion,” or the interference with the
neighbouring toes, upon whose territory the larger
digit is encroaching, may give rise to actual and
even intolerable suffering. In the milder examples
the use of a well-shaped boot, and a stocking made
with a separate pocket for the great toe, as recommended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
by Mr. Ellis, will be sufficient to allow the
rectification of the defect, and to these elementary
measures may be superadded Bigg’s bunion spring,
which can be obtained from most instrument
makers, or a vertical septum may be introduced
into the boot in the normal position of the cleft
between the first and second toes. In the more
severe cases these plans of treatment are insufficient,
and we then have the choice of several
alternatives.</p>

<p>1. Section of the neck of the metatarsal bone
with excision of a cuneiform segment from the
tibial side has been performed successfully by
Mr. A. E. Barker.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> This allows the articulation,
together with the entire toe, to be restored to the
straight line, but the abnormal disposition of the
articular surfaces and ligaments remains uncorrected,
and there is reason to fear that trouble
would arise later.</p>

<p>2. Forcible rectification under an anæsthetic is
satisfactory for slighter cases. It may be aided
if necessary by subcutaneous section of the
opposing tendinous and ligamentous structures on
the tibular side, and the toe is fixed for two or
three weeks in plaster of Paris. The rectification
should be preserved by the use of properly constructed
shoes with a septum between the first and
second toes, when the patient begins to walk.</p>

<p>3. Resection of the joint is undoubtedly the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
best operation in the more severe operations of
hallux valgus. Involving the obliteration of an
important articulation, it was feared that it might
induce serious crippling, but the plan has been
adopted with perfect success by Mr. Clutton<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> who,
excising the cartilaginous extremities of the
bones and fixing the shafts in suitable position
by means of an ivory peg, has secured the best
results. During the last two years I have
applied the principle of the operation recommended
for hammer toe. Excision of the head
of the metatarsal bone is performed through a
longitudinal incision over the inner side of the
joint, the toe is then replaced and fixed for three
weeks in a slightly extended position by means
of plaster of Paris. The success of these measures
is far more complete than could have been anticipated
on theoretical grounds. The distal joint
appears to replace almost perfectly that which is
lost, and the locomotion is easy and unfatiguing.
In a case of my own the patient was able to walk
twenty miles a day within three months of the
operation.</p>

is due to the abnormally great development of the other toes
(not represented in Fig. <span class="allsmcap">A</span>).</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The following is a curious example of this
rare condition, in association with macrodactyly.
The patient, a boy aged eleven, was admitted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
into St. Thomas’s Hospital in March 1887, with a
deformity of the right great toe, dating from
infancy. The member was somewhat imperfectly
developed, and projected inwards almost at right
angles with the metatarsal bone. (See <a href="#figure15">Fig. 15, <span class="allsmcap">A</span>.</a>)
A slightly prominent integumental fold was present
on the inner side of the metatarso-phalangeal
joint, and the ligamentous and other fibrous
tissues beneath this resisted the replacement of
the digit in its normal line. The toe could be
moved feebly by an effort of the will, but the
abnormal direction of the member prevented the
muscles from exercising any useful function. The
smaller toes were distinctly hypertrophied, but
were otherwise well formed. The boy was unable
to wear a boot, and was completely crippled. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
toe was apparently useless, but it was judged
advisable to restore it to its natural position rather
than to amputate. This was effected by subcutaneous
division of the internal lateral ligament
and the application of a small plaster apparatus.
Fifteen days later the child left the hospital with
a light metal splint fixed to the inner side of the
foot and toe. Three years afterwards he presented
himself for examination, and it was found that the
good result was more than maintained, as the toe
was not only straight, but had acquired its normal
size and considerable power of movement. The
boy said he was able to walk seven or eight miles
without fatigue. The relative hypertrophy of the
lesser toes was still obvious.</p>

<h3 id="II_VII">LATERAL DEVIATION OF THE LESSER TOES.</h3>

<p>This is frequent in childhood. It was found
in twenty-five children, twelve males and
thirteen females, out of 800, the ages of the
subjects ranging between five and fourteen.
The version is usually at the first inter-phalangeal
joint, but may also be present in the
distal joint, and the toe much more frequently
diverges towards the tibial than towards the
fibular side (six to one). It may lie over or under
its neighbour. The fourth toe is affected in about
two-thirds of the cases, while the second, third,
and fifth toes take an almost equal share in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
making up the remaining third. It is symmetrical
in nearly two-thirds of the examples (sixteen out
of twenty-five). In the early stage the joint may
be straightened by passive force; but in the later,
reposition is opposed by ligamentous tension, and
perhaps by some alteration in the form of the
bone. Like hammer toe, it occurs only during
the developmental period, and there is no reason
to connect it with any special defect in the shape
of the shoe. In none of the examples under my
own observation was it associated with hallux
valgus; but a double hammer toe (third) was
present in one case, and version of the fingers in
three others. The children appeared to be in
good health. The deformity may usually be
relieved by the use of a splint, like that recommended
for hammer toe; but in some cases a
partial resection might be advisable.</p>

<p><i>Inversion of the little toe at the metatarso-phalangeal
joint</i> is occasionally met with. It appears
always to arise during the period of active growth
and is associated with shortening of the extensor
tendon. Subcutaneous section of the tendon
allows complete reposition, and the cure may be
made permanent by temporary fixation in plaster,
and subsequent attention to the feet. The origin
of the condition is obscure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<h3 id="II_VIII">ARTHRITIC DEFORMITIES OF THE TOES.</h3>

<p><i>Arthritic hammer toe</i> may be due to rheumatoid
arthritis, gout, rheumatism, or traumatic
inflammation. The variety dependent upon
rheumatoid arthritis is the most common of these,
and the most likely to be brought under the eye
of the surgeon. Its characteristics are as follows:
1. It is not limited to the developmental period,
and may occur at any age in association with the
causative disease, but it is most frequently met
with after middle life. 2. The deformity is usually
present in many or all of the toes and in both
feet, and may be associated with lateral (fibular)
displacement of the digits, and with bony outgrowths
at the margin of the affected articulations.
The movements of the joints are much more
impaired than in true hammer toe, owing to
changes in the cartilage; and fibrous ankylosis is
often present. 3. Manifestations of the causative
disease may be found in other parts of the
body.</p>

<p>In the great toe the direction of the distortion
appears to depend upon the size and position of the
osteophytic developments at the margin of the
affected articulation. Most commonly the position
simulated is that of hallux valgus, more rarely that
of hallux flexus, and we may also find a condition
in which the distal phalanx is bent upwards, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
that the nail approaches or even touches the dorsal
surface of the first phalanx. (See <a href="#figure16">Fig. 16, <span class="allsmcap">A</span>.</a>) This
is a painful deformity and calls for treatment. I
have not yet seen an arthritic hallux varus. It is
probably rare, because the form of the boot opposes
the divergence of the toe in the inward direction.</p>

</figure>

<p>It is unnecessary here to say anything as to
the nature and course of the general disease. As
a rule the case falls into the hands of the physician,
and the surgeon is rarely asked to intervene. It
must be pointed out, however, that the contractions
may cause severe inconvenience, and that
despite the intractable nature of the complaint the
reaction of the patient to surgical operation is
favourable, recovery being nearly as speedy as in
true hammer toe. I have on two occasions
operated with the result of considerable relief to
suffering, and without any surgical casualty. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
one instance eight toes underwent operation at a
single sitting, and the wounds all healed by immediate
union.</p>

<p>In gouty contractions of the toes the history of
the sudden and painful inflammatory attacks preceding
the deformity, the almost constant implication
of the first metatarso-phalangeal joint, and
the presence of other indications of gout leave no
question as to the nature of the disease. In this
affection the surgeon can rarely be called upon to
interfere. The distortions of the great toe are
generally associated with eversion—a valgus—and
complete ankylosis may supervene. Contractions
in association with acute rheumatism or acute
rheumatoid arthritis are comparatively rare.
Lastly, certain arthritic affections of neuropathic
origin may produce ankylosis of the joints, sometimes
in association with rapid atrophy of the
muscular and integumentary structures, as in a
case shown by the author at the Medical Society
in 1893 (<i>Trans.</i>, vol. xvii. p. 104).</p>

<h3 id="II_IX">PARALYTIC CONTRACTIONS OF THE TOES.</h3>

<p>Deformities of this kind may be met with in
association with various diseases of the nervous
system. The most common condition is a hammer
deformity of the lesser toes, with retraction at the
metatarso-phalangeal joint, and an exaggeration
of the plantar arch (paralytic cavus). This is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
probably due to paralysis of the interossei in
nearly all cases. Occasionally a single toe is
affected. In the great toe it may arise from
paralysis either of the short flexors or of the
tibialis anticus (as pointed out by Mr. Davies-Colley),
and is associated with retraction of the
first phalanx and flexion of the second. In the
smaller toes the digits assume a position like
that of the clawed finger in ulnar paralysis, with
extension of the proximal and flexion of the
middle and distal phalanges, but, unlike in true
hammer toe, there is distinct evidence of paralysis,
and the capacity of the flexed joints for passive
extension is usually retained for long periods. In
these cases where the unopposed extensor leads to
very inconvenient retraction of the first phalanx
the tendon may be divided, and Mr. Davies-Colley
suggests that the proximal cut end should be
fixed to the metatarsal bone in order to preserve
its utility as a dorsal flexor of the ankle. The
return of the deformity must be prevented by the
subsequent use of splints and manipulation.</p>

a variety of other irregularities and deficiencies
of nutrition, numerical increase of parts and
abnormal union of digits. These defects are often
hereditary, they may co-exist in various combinations,

<p>The earliest examples of “congenital hypertrophy”
recorded in this country were those of
Dr. Reid, published in the <i>London and Edinburgh</i>
<i>Monthly Journal of Medical Science</i> for March
1843, but before this date a characteristic case of
makrodactyly had been carefully described by von
Klein,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and other instances had been brought
forward by Beck<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and Wagner.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Reid’s paper
was followed by a valuable article by Curling,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>

first attempt to classify the cases was that of
Busch,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> in 1866. Since this time many additions
have been made to the literature of the subject,
the most important of which are those of Trelat
and Monod,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Vogt,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> von Fischer,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Wittelshöfer,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
and Humphry.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The condition may be defined as a gigantic
growth, congenital in origin, of various segments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
of the body exclusive of the viscera. It is generally
unilateral, and limited to one extremity or
portion of an extremity; it tends to implicate
especially the bones and joints, and the adipose
and vascular elements of the subcutaneous tissue.
It does not, as a rule, impair to any important
extent the functional capacity of the part.</p>

<p>The name “congenital hypertrophy” is open to
criticism. There is little doubt that the abnormality
always has its origin in fœtal life, but it has seldom
been noticed immediately after the delivery of a
child; and, on the other hand, in one case recorded
by Lannelongue,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> a “<i>macrodactylie elephantiasique</i>”
in a child is said to have followed an
operation for the separation of two united fingers.
It is, at any rate, certain that if the enlargement
be always present at birth, it is seldom so
disproportionate as to attract attention and never
so great as to interfere with parturition. Hence
the colossal proportions subsequently observed are
the result of excessive growth in early infancy and
childhood, and occasionally in adult life.</p>

<p>The hyperplasia, moreover, is rarely hypertrophic
in the higher sense of the term, for, although in a
few cases the increased growth has been associated
with apparent increase of functional utility, in the
great majority of instances it is relegated to a
lower status by its unequal distribution amongst
the different tissues of the parts involved, its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
frequent association with other congenital deformities,
and especially by the defective ratio of
functional capacity to the amount of constructive
material. In other words, the process is wasteful
and unserviceable.</p>

<p>The origin of the affection is very obscure. It
is not hereditary, although inheritance plays a
notable part in many other congenital deformities,
and it cannot be attributed to any known influences
arising during intra-uterine life, but, as
might be expected, the mother is often able to
conjure up some reminiscence of the period of
gestation which to her mind affords a perfectly
satisfactory clue to the mystery. Von Klein
relates that in his case of makrodactyly the
mother while pregnant was bitten in the hand by
a goose. A history of a fright was given in
Adams’s case, and in an instance reported by the
author<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> a giant growth of the lower extremity
was attributed to the mother having been trodden
upon by a cow. Such mental impressions are
probably mere coincidences, and are often greatly
exaggerated in narration, but until the possibility
of their connection with fœtal lesions
is disproved it is advisable to place them on
record.</p>

<p><i>Parts affected.</i>—The abnormality is usually
limited to one side of the body. Comparatively
few bilateral cases have been observed, and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
most of these the makroplasia was limited to the
digits.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The nævi with which the hypertrophy is often
associated are nearly always confined to the affected
side, but in two cases of Chassaignac and Friedberg
they were found also upon the non-hypertrophied
side, and in a second case of Chassaignac’s were
present only upon the unenlarged parts of the
body. The upper extremity is attacked nearly
twice as often as the lower, and the right side
much more frequently than the left. In bilateral
cases the affection is seldom symmetrical; thus, on
one of Friedberg’s cases the predominant enlargement
of the right lower extremity was associated
with a small degree of hypertrophy of the left
upper limb.</p>

<p>The extent of the parts involved ranges from a
single digit to an entire half of the body. When
a whole limb is implicated the growth is always
proportionately greater at the distal extremity,
but colossal development of the hand or foot
seldom includes the whole of the digits. The
localisation of the affection does not appear to be
related to any special vascular or nervous territories;
thus, in makrodactyly, the regions of
distribution of the digital branches of both median
and ulnar nerves may be encroached upon, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
parts supplied by either or both of these may
escape intact.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp42" id="figure18" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure18.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="main"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span></p>
  <p class="sub">Congenital hypertrophy of lower extremity, with lymphangeiomata
(from a case of the author’s).</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Commonly, however, both in the hand and foot,
the hypertrophy selects two or three neighbouring
digits, for example, the second and third; and
co-existent lipomata are almost invariably limited
to that portion of the palm or sole which corresponds
to the enlarged fingers or toes. In the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
hand the digit most commonly affected is the third,
the fifth is that most exempt.</p>

<p>Its <i>course</i> is always in a certain sense progressive.
Occasionally it appears to keep pace
throughout with the general growth of the body,
but nearly always the abnormal growth strides in
advance, sooner or later, so that the disproportion
of the affected part to the rest of the body
becomes more and more pronounced. Its progress
may be uniform and continuous, or terms of slow
increase or apparent arrest may alternate with a
new and rapid development.</p>

<p>In some instances the process does not extend
beyond the primary limits, while in others it may
spread centripetally, and often at a very rapid
rate, as in v. Fischer’s case (<i>l.c.</i>), in which amputation
of an hypertrophied finger was followed
within a few months by hypertrophy of the whole
limb. In two cases reported by Mr. F. S. Eve<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> a
growth became disproportionally active at the
ages of twenty-three and thirty-seven respectively.
Similar instances have been published by Wittelshöfer,
and the author (<i>l.c.</i>).</p>

<p>The addition of new tissue goes on, as a rule,
without pain, inflammation, or interference with
function; but in a case of von Fischer’s, burning
pain was associated with trophic ulceration; and
Friedberg’s patient,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> who appeared to be the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
subject of an associated elephantiasis Arabum, had
symptoms that somewhat resembled the inflammation
crises of elephantiasis.</p>

<p>In the majority of cases the <i>functional power</i>
of the enlarged part is not augmented, but true
unilateral hypertrophy, <i>i.e.</i>, increased tissue hypertrophy
with proportionally increased functional
activity, is sometimes found. The cases described
long since in general terms by Geoffroy St. Hilaire,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
as marked by an unequal development of the two
sides of the body in one or more regions, were
probably of this nature, and those of Ollier,
Finlayson, and Langlet, may also claim a place in
the same class. In Ollier’s case<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> the face, thorax,
abdomen, and both extremities of one side, were
uniformly larger than the corresponding parts of
the opposite half of the body, the vascularity of
the hypertrophied side was increased, the temperature
elevated, and the limbs were more powerful.
There were no nævoid growths, and it is noteworthy
that in association with an absence of
evident abnormality of thoracic, pelvic, and
abdominal viscera, the mammary glands preserved
their symmetry. The cases of Devouges, Adams,
and Finlayson, also presented certain points of
resemblance to true hypertrophy. In the first the
whole of one side was hypertrophied, except<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
perhaps the abdominal wall, where nothing
unusual was noticed. The details are very imperfect,
but according to the patient’s statement,
the strength of the arm on the hypertrophied
side was greatly in excess of that of its fellow.
In Adams’s case the giant growth of the right
lower extremity was apparently uniform, and the
femoral and all other accessible arteries were
considerably enlarged, but nothing is said as to
muscular power. In this as in the last example
nævi were present. In an unpublished case of the
author’s the hypertrophied hand was much stronger
than its fellow; but in the example<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> already
quoted there was no evidence of increased development
of muscle. In two instances of unilateral
hypertrophy of the face described by Friedrich<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
and Passauer,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> the increased growth involved the
whole of the parts of the affected side, even to the
teeth and tongue, and in Friedrich’s patient, and
in a case brought by Dr. Heumann before a
Medical Congress in Darmstadt, the hair was
more developed, and the secretion of saliva was
excessive on the affected side, but the muscular
power and arterial supply were not specially
referred to. In a case of Eve’s the facial hypertrophy
extended to the brain.</p>

<p>In the ordinary forms of congenital hypertrophy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
the size of the part is augmented by an unequally
distributed hyperplasia of the skeleton and soft
parts. Almost all the cases narrated in detail are
of this kind. In nearly all, the arterial supply is
proportionate only to the normal size of the part,
and the functional capacity (power, sensibility, &amp;c.),
although not seriously altered, is to some extent
deteriorated. The cases may be for practical purposes
divided into two groups:</p>

<p>1. Without deformity, the enlarged segment
preserving the normal contour in other respects.</p>

<p>2. With deformity.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>a.</i> From predominant development of the
adipose or vascular tissues.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> From secondary articular distortions.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> From associated defects of development,
as syndactyly, &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p>The condition of the different elements of the
enlarged part is as follows:</p>

<p>The <i>bones</i> are always enlarged. Their general
shape is commonly preserved, but occasionally
their extremities are deformed by outgrowths at
the line of junction with the articular cartilage.
The hypertrophy reaches its greatest proportionate
extent in the digits, while increase in size of the
bones of the forearm, arm, leg, and thigh, is, as a
rule, only demonstrable during life by admeasurement
of length. No histological abnormality has
been detected in the osseous tissue, but Eve (<i>l.c.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
found the cancellous tissue of the enlarged bone
soft and the medulla fatty.</p>

<p>The <i>articular surfaces</i> may present no peculiar
features, but in some cases the cartilages show
irregularities of surface. The ligaments are
usually greatly thickened. The synovial membrane
commonly has the ordinary characters,
varied only by an excessive development of the
plicæ adiposæ.</p>

<p>The range of motion is sometimes normal; in
other cases the voluntary movements are more or
less diminished in extent, while a fair amount of
passive mobility is preserved; and in others there
is complete ankylosis.</p>

<p>Distortions, such as lateral deviation and
hyper-extension, are frequent. The former appears
to depend upon malformation of bone.</p>

<p>The <i>tendons</i> inserted into the enlarged bones
have been found proportionately over-developed.
The <i>muscles</i>, however, are seldom hypertrophied,
and occasionally, as in Busch’s case, they may
undergo an atrophy secondary to the impaired
mobility of the joint. In a case of von Fischer’s,
muscular hypertrophy was demonstrated, but no
evidence of increased power was present; and,
judging by the comparative disuse of the limb, it
is probable that the strength was lessened. The
muscular power is, as a rule, so far augmented in
response to functional necessity that the enlarged
part may be used without more sense of effort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
than that which accompanies the same actions on
the normal side, as in Wagner’s case (<i>l.c.</i>), in
which the hand weighed about twelve pounds and
yet could be moved with perfect ease; there is
seldom, however, any such absolute increase of
strength as would indicate a genuine muscular
hypertrophy.</p>

<p>The <i>arteries</i> in all the instances of false hypertrophy,
with the exception of Reid’s<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> cases, were
of ordinary size and apparently not enlarged in
proportion to the gigantic development of the
part to be nourished. This is a fact of considerable
pathological significance.</p>

<p>The <i>veins</i> and <i>capillaries</i>, unlike the arteries,
appear especially liable to change. Varicosities of
the veins are very common, and in some cases
great thickening of the walls may be superadded
(Busch, <i>l.c.</i>). In Dr. Finlayson’s case the cutaneous
vessels over the enlarged parts and in patches
over the trunk became enlarged when the child
cried, but subsided during quiescence.</p>

<p>In Wagner’s case the fingers of the hypertrophied
hand were said to become as red as a
“Blutschwamm” when the member hung down,
the arteries being nevertheless of normal size.</p>

<p>Angiectases and angiomata are frequently seen.
Capillary nævi of enormous extent sometimes co-exist
(as in Adams’s case, in which the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
lower extremity and buttock were involved), and
are usually, but not invariably, confined to the
hypertrophied parts.</p>

<p>The <i>lymphatics</i> are liable to dilatation, and
may form diffuse swellings or soft tumours of
considerable extent. The glands, however, are
never affected.</p>

<p>The <i>nerves</i> appear to be normal. The condition
of the nerve centres has not yet been investigated
except in a case of Eve’s, in which the lateral
asymmetry of the head and face extended to the
brain.</p>

<p>The <i>integuments</i> nearly always participate in
the changes, and are necessarily augmented in
extent where covering the enlarged bones. The
derm does not appear to be much altered in
structure, but Eve found in the skin over the
hypertrophied sole a thinning of the rete with
almost complete obliteration of papillæ and enormous
thickening of the fibrous tissues and
inter-fascicular lymph spaces; but these changes
were probably due to the abnormal pressure and
friction to which the part was exposed. The
subcutaneous adipose layer commonly shows a
diffuse thickening, and in addition may undergo a
circumscribed hypertrophy in the form of large
lipomatous pads, which are mostly found upon
the flexor aspect of the member affected, and correspond
in situation and extent to the bony enlargement
(<a href="#figure18">Fig. 18</a>); but the papillary and epithelial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
layers do not undergo any sensible changes, nor,
as a rule, are the hairs or sebaceous follicles more
developed than on the opposite side. The nails
of hypertrophied digits generally undergo proportionate
development. The secretion of perspiration
is seldom altered in amount or character,
but in a case of Wittelshöfer the patient complained
of profuse sweating from the affected
limb. The cutaneous sensibility is variously
described as unaffected or diminished, never
increased. A reduction of the sensibility to heat
and pain was found to accompany the tactile
defect in von Fischer’s case, and it is probable, as
he suggests, that careful examination would
generally reveal an impairment of the faculties.
Pain is rarely complained of. Burning pain was
present in association with trophic ulceration in a
case of von Fischer, and pains of a rheumatic
character appeared in the author’s case, but this
symptom probably formed no part of the original
disease.</p>

<p>The <i>temperature</i> of the part is generally normal.
By exception, a rise of 2°-2½° Fahr., of 2°-6° Fahr.
(Reid), 2°-4° Fahr. (Finlayson), and of ½°-1° Cent.
(Trelat and Monod) has been recorded.</p>

<p><i>Pathological complications</i> are rarely met with.
Trophic ulceration appeared in a case of von
Fischer’s; and in Friedberg’s case an eruption
resembling pemphigus was noted, but probably
was not directly connected with the congenital<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
hypertrophy. Inflammatory crises, corresponding
to those of elephantiasis Arabum, have been seen
in only one instance, and in this the condition
appeared to be complicated by true elephantiasis.</p>

<p><i>Associated defects of development</i> are frequent
in connection with makrodactyly. They may consist
of multiplication, dwarfing, absence, or fusion
of parts. The most common defect is syndactyly.
Secondary distortions of the spine are found, however,
when the hypertrophy of a single limb is
very great. The general health does not appear
to be affected by the condition.</p>

<p><i>Pathology.</i>—The older views as to the pathological
origin of congenital hypertrophy leave us
little advanced towards a solution. The condition
has been attributed to a congenital lesion of the
vaso-motor centres; to a primitive vice in the
mesoblast; and to an inherent tendency of the
affected tissues to appropriate an excess of
nutriment; but these theories only lead to the
same point—that for some reason which our
pathology is still inadequate to explain, there is a
weakening of the governing power that regulates
the ratio between supply and demand in the
tissues; or, to quote from Professor Humphry
(<i>l.c.</i>), “The cases obviously consist in an excess,
an abnormally excessive growth of a normal part
of the body—an excess not depending upon any
superabundance of nutritive supply, or any modification
of nerve influence, but upon an excess, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
want of due restraint, of that developmental force
by which the several organs and structures acquire
and maintain their proper dimensions and relations
to one another, and by which their relative growth
at different periods of life and under different
circumstances (as of the genital organs at puberty).
The nature and essence and habitat or source of
the force is a mystery, perhaps past finding
out.”</p>

<p>This sums up the whole question. It is probably
the same kind of misgovernment of tissue that
leads to certain other deformities occurring both
before and after birth, and to the development of
some forms of new growth. How it originates
remains for the pathologists of the future to
decide.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>—No means yet devised has any
power of restraining the tendency for the excessive
and irregular growth in this condition. The only
resources of the surgeon are to correct associated
deformities as far as possible, and to remove parts
that are sufficiently inconvenient or disfiguring to
warrant the use of the knife.</p>

<h3 id="III_II">SUPERNUMERARY FINGERS AND TOES.</h3>

<p>The occasional occurrence of supernumerary fingers
and toes is well known. As a rule the extra digit
is a mere pediculated appendage bearing a nail
and a more or less perfect representative of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
ungual phalanx; in other cases, however, it is
complete and well formed, and furnished with a
metacarpal or metatarsal bone of its own, or
sharing the proximal bone with a neighbouring
finger or toe. In rare instances the digits may
undergo still further numeral increase even to a
complete duplication of the normal complement.</p>

<p>The condition is commonly bilateral, and may
affect all four extremities. It is liable to association
with syndactyly and other congenital
deformities, and it is occasionally handed down by
inheritance as a family peculiarity. Sir William
Lawrence refers to a condition of the kind which
was traced through four generations, and other
examples are on record.</p>

<h3 id="III_III">SYNDACTYLY.</h3>

<p>The absence of one or more of the normal
clefts between the fingers or toes is a common
congenital deformity, and, like most of the other
inherited defects of the parts, is often transmitted
by descent, and associated with other
malformations.</p>

<p>Syndactyly presents all varieties in extent and
degree. Most frequently two neighbouring digits
are joined together by a web of integument involving
the whole or a portion of their length, but
in some instances the connecting material is much
thicker, and in the most extreme cases even the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
bones and joints are fused, leaving nothing but a
furrow to indicate the line of union. (<a href="#figure17">Fig. 17,
Nos. 16 to 19.</a>)</p>

<p>Treatment is rarely necessary in the case of
the foot, and in the hand is practicable only
when the band of union is cutaneous or cellulo-cutaneous.</p>

<p>If the web is composed only of a thin double
fold of integument it is sufficient to divide it,
provided that a return of the condition is prevented
from taking place through union of the raw
surfaces at the root of the web. This was formerly
effected in the slighter cases by a preliminary
perforation of the base of the fold, and the
insertion of a piece of gold wire until a cicatricial
canal has been established—as in piercing the
lobule for the suspension of an ear-ring—and the
same end may be gained after the division by
putting a small epidermic graft upon the angle.
Zeller’s flap method is, however, the best. A small
triangular flap is cut from the dorsum of the hand
with its base opposite the heads of the metacarpal
bones, its apex at the level of the first inter-phalangeal
joint. This being dissected up and
reversed, the whole length of the web is divided.
The apex of the flap is then brought forwards
between the separated digits into the proximal
end of the cleft, and fixed to the cut edge of the
palmar integument.</p>

<p>When the membrane is very thick, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
bones are drawn close together, a more complicated
proceeding is required, and the ingenious
method of Didot may be employed. A longitudinal
incision is carried through the whole thickness of
the integument along the middle of the dorsum of
one of the two united fingers, a second along the
middle of the palmar aspect of the other finger,
and by dissection each digit is made to furnish a
rectangular flap to cover in the raw surface of its
neighbour. The division of the tissue left after
raising the flaps must be made with great care, in
order to avoid injury to the digital nerves.</p>

<h3 id="III_IV">ECTRODACTYLY.</h3>

<p>Simple congenital ectrodactyly, like the loss of
a larger segment of an extremity, may arise either
by intra-uterine traumatism or defective development.
Amputation by an amniotic band or a coil
of umbilical cord probably explains the majority
of the cases, as well as the congenital constrictions
sometimes found in the limbs or digits of the newborn
child, but the occasional appearance of
fingers or toes at the end of a congenital stump
can only be accounted for on the hypothesis of a
temporary suspension of development in the
proximal portion of the stump, and we may
assume the possibility of a like origin for the
absence of the most distal portions of a member.
In some instances an ectrodactyly is complicated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
with other developmental errors, and may be
transmitted through several generations. Attention
has been especially drawn to cases of this
class in the last few years. Two were recorded
in detail in 1886 by Dr. Fotherby<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and the
author,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and a third was added five years ago by
Messrs. Parker and Robinson.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> In all of these
the defect was traced through three or four
generations, selecting in an apparently indiscriminate
way a large portion of the members of the
family, whilst leaving others exempt. In some
individuals all four limbs were attacked, in others
the upper or lower only, but usually with a more
or less perfect bilateral symmetry. In most cases
the ectrodactyly was associated with deformities
of the remaining digits, such as syndactyly,
hypertrophy, and joint distortions; and where, as
frequently happened, the middle digits were imperfectly
developed and the others hypertrophied
and distorted, the member assumed the appearance
of the pincers of a lobster. (<a href="#figure17">Fig. 17, Nos. 11
to 14.</a>)</p>

<p>In Dr. Fotherby’s and Messrs. Parker and
Robinson’s cases the defects were traced through
three generations, affecting sixteen out of thirty-seven
descendants in the one and sixteen out of
thirty-three in the other; in the author’s case the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
history extended to four generations, attacking
twenty-four out of thirty-six children, and the
divergence from the normal state tended to
increase with the later scions.</p>

<p>As a rule, little or no treatment is called for in
this condition, because habit has given the
member a good deal of functional utility that
surgical interference might injure or destroy; but
sometimes, and more particularly in the feet, it is
permissible to operate for the purpose of lessening
the deformity, as in Messrs. Parker and Robinson’s
case, where a plastic operation was performed with
much benefit to the patient.</p>

<h3 id="III_V">BRACHYDACTYLY.</h3>

<p>Undue shortness of the fingers or toes may
occur either as a congenital or as an acquired
defect. The congenital form, due to imperfect
formation of any or all of the bony elements of a
digit (including the metacarpal bone), is insusceptible
of treatment except by amputation, should
that step be justified by the inconvenience or
deformity attached to the defective member.</p>

<p>Acquired brachydactyly may arise in several
ways. Occasionally it is to be traced to an arrest
of development either due to an injury during childhood
or adolescence, or without apparent explanation,
but more frequently it is a result of disease.
In younger subjects the most common cause is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
destruction of bone in tuberculous disease, which
may practically eliminate a phalanx, leaving the
rest healthy. In older people it may be met
with in cases of perforating ulcer, the proximal
phalanx of the great toe and sometimes other
bones undergoing a slow and painless disintegration,
which is manifested chiefly by a progressive
shortening of the digit with few or none of the
more obvious signs of caries.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> It is unnecessary to enter minutely into the conformation of the
inter-phalangeal joints, but it must be understood that the proximal
attachment of the plantar fibres of the lateral ligaments lies at a point
below the centre of the dorsal half of the condylar curve, and hence
these fibres become more and more stretched as their distal attachment
is carried upwards in the direction of extension, until at last the
motion is checked by their tension. The point at which the arrest
occurs necessarily depends upon the relation existing between the
length of the fibres and that of the radii of the condylar curve. If
the ligaments of a joint be artificially elongated by acrobatic training
in early life, they may lose their power of fixing the range of movement,
and extension may then go on until it is stopped by contact of
bones or by contraction of opposing muscles. The latter factor, of
course, is always an important one, but it does not affect the present
aspect of the question.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[12]</a> It must be recollected that morphologically the metatarso-phalangeal
joint of the great toe corresponds to the first inter-phalangeal
joint of the smaller digits.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
